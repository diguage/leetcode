= 1648. Sell Diminishing-Valued Colored Balls

{leetcode}/problems/sell-diminishing-valued-colored-balls/[LeetCode - 1648. Sell Diminishing-Valued Colored Balls ^]

You have an `inventory` of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants `orders` balls of *any* color.

The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is the number of balls *of that color *you currently have in your `inventory`. For example, if you own `6` yellow balls, the customer would pay `6` for the first yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only `5` yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at `5` (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).

You are given an integer array, `inventory`, where `inventory[i]` represents the number of balls of the `i^th^` color that you initially own. You are also given an integer `orders`, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. You can sell the balls *in any order*.

Return _the *maximum* total value that you can attain after selling _`orders`_ colored balls_. As the answer may be too large, return it *modulo *`10^9 ^+ 7`.

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* inventory = [2,5], orders = 4
*Output:* 14
*Explanation:* Sell the 1st color 1 time (2) and the 2nd color 3 times (5 + 4 + 3).
The maximum total value is 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 14.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* inventory = [3,5], orders = 6
*Output:* 19
*Explanation: *Sell the 1st color 2 times (3 + 2) and the 2nd color 4 times (5 + 4 + 3 + 2).
The maximum total value is 3 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 19.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= inventory.length <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= inventory[i] <= 10^9^`
* `1 <= orders <= min(sum(inventory[i]), 10^9^)`
