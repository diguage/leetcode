= 1857. Largest Color Value in a Directed Graph

https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-color-value-in-a-directed-graph/[LeetCode - 1857. Largest Color Value in a Directed Graph ^]

There is a *directed graph* of `n` colored nodes and `m` edges. The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given a string `colors` where `colors[i]` is a lowercase English letter representing the *color* of the `i^th^` node in this graph (*0-indexed*). You are also given a 2D array `edges` where `edges[j] = [a<sub>j</sub>, b<sub>j</sub>]` indicates that there is a *directed edge* from node `a<sub>j</sub>` to node `b<sub>j</sub>`.

A valid *path* in the graph is a sequence of nodes `x<sub>1</sub> -> x<sub>2</sub> -> x<sub>3</sub> -> ... -> x<sub>k</sub>` such that there is a directed edge from `x<sub>i</sub>` to `x<sub>i+1</sub>` for every `1 <= i < k`. The *color value* of the path is the number of nodes that are colored the *most frequently* occurring color along that path.

Return _the *largest color value* of any valid path in the given graph, or _`-1`_ if the graph contains a cycle_.

----
*Input:* colors = "abaca", edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* The path 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 contains 3 nodes that are colored `"a" (red in the above image)`.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/21/leet2.png" style="width: 85px; height: 85px;" />

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* colors = "a", edges = [[0,0]]
*Output:* -1
*Explanation:* There is a cycle from 0 to 0.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == colors.length`
* `m == edges.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `0 <= m <= 10^5^`
* `colors` consists of lowercase English letters.
* `0 <= a<sub>j</sub>, b<sub>j</sub> < n`
