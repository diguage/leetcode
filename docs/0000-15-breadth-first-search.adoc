= Breadth First Search 广度优先搜索

== Tree Breadth First Search，树上的BFS

这种模式基于宽搜（Breadth First Search (BFS)），适用于需要遍历一颗树。借助于队列数据结构，从而能保证树的节点按照他们的层数打印出来。打印完当前层所有元素，才能执行到下一层。所有这种需要遍历树且需要一层一层遍历的问题，都能用这种模式高效解决。

这种树上的BFS模式是通过把根节点加到队列中，然后不断遍历直到队列为空。每一次循环中，我们都会把队头结点拿出来（remove），然后对其进行必要的操作。在删除每个节点的同时，其孩子节点，都会被加到队列中。

识别树上的BFS模式：

* 如果你被问到去遍历树，需要按层操作的方式（也称作层序遍历）
