= 605. Can Place Flowers

https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/[LeetCode - Can Place Flowers]

Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number *n*, return if *n* new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

*Example 1:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
*Output:* True
----


*Example 2:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
*Output:* False
----


*Note:*

. The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.
. The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].
. *n* is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.
