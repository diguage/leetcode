= 1916. Count Ways to Build Rooms in an Ant Colony

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-ways-to-build-rooms-in-an-ant-colony/[LeetCode - 1916. Count Ways to Build Rooms in an Ant Colony ^]

You are an ant tasked with adding `n` new rooms numbered `0` to `n-1` to your colony. You are given the expansion plan as a *0-indexed* integer array of length `n`, `prevRoom`, where `prevRoom[i]` indicates that you must build room `prevRoom[i]` before building room `i`, and these two rooms must be connected *directly*. Room `0` is already built, so `prevRoom[0] = -1`. The expansion plan is given such that once all the rooms are built, every room will be reachable from room `0`.

You can only build *one room* at a time, and you can travel freely between rooms you have *already built* only if they are *connected*. You can choose to build *any room* as long as its *previous room* is already built.

Return _the *number of different orders* you can build all the rooms in_. Since the answer may be large, return it *modulo* `10^9^ + 7`.

*Input:* prevRoom = [-1,0,1]
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* There is only one way to build the additional rooms: 0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 2

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
*<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/19/d2.JPG" style="width: 200px; height: 239px;" />*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* prevRoom = [-1,0,0,1,2]
*Output:* 6
*Explanation:
*The 6 ways are:
0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 4
0 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 4 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 3
0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 4
0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 4 &rarr; 3
0 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 4
0 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 4 &rarr; 3
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == prevRoom.length`
* `2 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `prevRoom[0] == -1`
* `0 <= prevRoom[i] < n` for all `1 <= i < n`
* Every room is reachable from room `0` once all the rooms are built.
