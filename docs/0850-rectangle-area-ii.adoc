= 850. Rectangle Area II

https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-area-ii/[LeetCode - Rectangle Area II]

We are given a list of (axis-aligned) `rectangles`.  Each `rectangle[i] = [x1, y1, x2, y2] `, where (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner of the `i`th rectangle.

Find the total area covered by all `rectangles` in the plane.  Since the answer may be too large, *return it modulo 10^9 + 7*.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [[0,0,2,2],[1,0,2,3],[1,0,3,1]]
*Output:* 6
*Explanation:* As illustrated in the picture.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [[0,0,1000000000,1000000000]]
*Output:* 49
*Explanation:* The answer is 10^18 modulo (10^9 + 7), which is (10^9)^2 = (-7)^2 = 49.
----

*Note:*


* `1 <= rectangles.length <= 200`
* `<font face="monospace">rectanges[i].length = 4`
* `0 <= rectangles[i][j] <= 10^9`
* The total area covered by all rectangles will never exceed `2^63 - 1` and thus will fit in a 64-bit signed integer.
