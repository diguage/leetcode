= 1339. Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-splitted-binary-tree/[LeetCode - Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree]

Given a binary tree `root`. Split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing 1 edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees are maximized.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
*Output:* 110
*Explanation:* Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 11 and 10. Their product is 110 (11*10)
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* root = [1,null,2,3,4,null,null,5,6]
*Output:* 90
*Explanation:*  Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 15 and 6.Their product is 90 (15*6)
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* root = [2,3,9,10,7,8,6,5,4,11,1]
*Output:* 1025
----

*Example 4:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* root = [1,1]
*Output:* 1
----

 
*Constraints:*


* Each tree has at most `50000` nodes and at least `2` nodes.
* Each node's value is between `[1, 10000]`.
