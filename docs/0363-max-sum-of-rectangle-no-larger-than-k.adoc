= 363. Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K

https://leetcode.com/problems/max-sum-of-rectangle-no-larger-than-k/[LeetCode - Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K^]

Given a non-empty 2D matrix _matrix_ and an integer _k_, find the max sum of a rectangle in the _matrix_ such that its sum is no larger than _k_.

*Example:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* matrix = [[1,0,1],[0,-2,3]], k = 2
*Output:* 2 
*Explanation:* Because the sum of rectangle `[[0, 1], [-2, 3]]` is 2,
             and 2 is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).
----

*Note:*


. The rectangle inside the matrix must have an area > 0.
. What if the number of rows is much larger than the number of columns?
