= 1192. Critical Connections in a Network

https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/[LeetCode - Critical Connections in a Network]

There are `n` servers numbered from `0` to `n-1` connected by undirected server-to-server `connections` forming a network where `connections[i] = [a, b]` represents a connection between servers `a` and `b`. Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.

A _critical connection_ is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

*Output:* [[1,3]]
*Explanation:* [[3,1]] is also accepted.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `n-1 <= connections.length <= 10^5`
* `connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]`
* There are no repeated connections.
