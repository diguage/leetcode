看懂了这道题，相声就已经入门了……

Matrix67 的解释 http://www.matrix67.com/blog/archives/3870[Conway常数是怎么得来的？ | Matrix67: The Aha Moments] 还是非常浅显易懂的！

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
----

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.


`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.


`21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer _n_ where 1 ≤ _n_ ≤ 30, generate the _n_^th^ term of the count-and-say sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* 1
*Output:* "1"
*Explanation:* This is the base case.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* 4
*Output:* "1211"
*Explanation:* For n = 3 the term was "21" in which we have two groups "2" and "1", "2" can be read as "12" which means frequency = 1 and value = 2, the same way "1" is read as "11", so the answer is the concatenation of "12" and "11" which is "1211".
