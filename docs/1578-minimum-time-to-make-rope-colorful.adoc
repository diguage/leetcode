= 1578. Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-make-rope-colorful/[LeetCode - 1578. Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful ^]

Alice has `n` balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a *0-indexed* string `colors` where `colors[i]` is the color of the `i^th^` balloon.

Alice wants the rope to be *colorful*. She does not want *two consecutive balloons* to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it *colorful*. You are given a *0-indexed* integer array `neededTime` where `neededTime[i]` is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the `i^th^` balloon from the rope.

Return _the *minimum time* Bob needs to make the rope *colorful*_.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/ballon1.jpg" style="width: 404px; height: 243px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* colors = "abaac", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* In the above image, 'a' is blue, 'b' is red, and 'c' is green.
Bob can remove the blue balloon at index 2. This takes 3 seconds.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 3.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/balloon2.jpg" style="width: 244px; height: 243px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* colors = "abc", neededTime = [1,2,3]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* The rope is already colorful. Bob does not need to remove any balloons from the rope.

----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/balloon3.jpg" style="width: 404px; height: 243px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* colors = "aabaa", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,1]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* Bob will remove the balloons at indices 0 and 4. Each balloons takes 1 second to remove.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 1 + 1 = 2.

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == colors.length == neededTime.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= neededTime[i] <= 10^4^`
* `colors` contains only lowercase English letters.
