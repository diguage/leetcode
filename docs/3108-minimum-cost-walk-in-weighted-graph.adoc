= 3108. Minimum Cost Walk in Weighted Graph

{leetcode}/problems/minimum-cost-walk-in-weighted-graph/[LeetCode - 3108. Minimum Cost Walk in Weighted Graph ^]

There is an undirected weighted graph with `n` vertices labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given the integer `n` and an array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>]` indicates that there is an edge between vertices `u<sub>i</sub>` and `v<sub>i</sub>` with a weight of `w<sub>i</sub>`.

A walk on a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges. The walk starts and ends with a vertex, and each edge connects the vertex that comes before it and the vertex that comes after it. It's important to note that a walk may visit the same edge or vertex more than once.

The *cost* of a walk starting at node `u` and ending at node `v` is defined as the bitwise `AND` of the weights of the edges traversed during the walk. In other words, if the sequence of edge weights encountered during the walk is `w<sub>0</sub>, w<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>, ..., w<sub>k</sub>`, then the cost is calculated as `w<sub>0</sub> &amp; w<sub>1</sub> &amp; w<sub>2</sub> &amp; ... &amp; w<sub>k</sub>`, where `&amp;` denotes the bitwise `AND` operator.

You are also given a 2D array `query`, where `query[i] = [s<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>i</sub>]`. For each query, you need to find the minimum cost of the walk starting at vertex `s<sub>i</sub>` and ending at vertex `t<sub>i</sub>`. If there exists no such walk, the answer is `-1`.

Return _the array _`answer`_, where _`answer[i]`_ denotes the *minimum* cost of a walk for query _`i`.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">n = 5, edges = [[0,1,7],[1,3,7],[1,2,1]], query = [[0,3],[3,4]]

*Output:* <span class="example-io">[1,-1]

*Explanation:*

To achieve the cost of 1 in the first query, we need to move on the following edges: `0->1` (weight 7), `1->2` (weight 1), `2->1` (weight 1), `1->3` (weight 7).

In the second query, there is no walk between nodes 3 and 4, so the answer is -1.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*


<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">n = 3, edges = [[0,2,7],[0,1,15],[1,2,6],[1,2,1]], query = [[1,2]]

*Output:* <span class="example-io">[0]

*Explanation:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/01/31/q4_example2e.png" style="padding: 10px; background: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-radius: 0.5rem; width: 211px; height: 181px;" />
To achieve the cost of 0 in the first query, we need to move on the following edges: `1->2` (weight 1), `2->1` (weight 6), `1->2` (weight 1).


 
*Constraints:*


* `2 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `0 <= edges.length <= 10^5^`
* `edges[i].length == 3`
* `0 <= u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub> <= n - 1`
* `u<sub>i</sub> != v<sub>i</sub>`
* `0 <= w<sub>i</sub> <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= query.length <= 10^5^`
* `query[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= s<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>i</sub> <= n - 1`
* `s<sub>i</sub> != t<sub>i</sub>`
