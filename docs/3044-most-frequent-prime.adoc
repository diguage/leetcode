= 3044. Most Frequent Prime

{leetcode}/problems/most-frequent-prime/[LeetCode - 3044. Most Frequent Prime ^]

You are given a `m x n` *0-indexed *2D* *matrix `mat`. From every cell, you can create numbers in the following way:


* There could be at most `8` paths from the cells namely: east, south-east, south, south-west, west, north-west, north, and north-east.
* Select a path from them and append digits in this path to the number being formed by traveling in this direction.
* Note that numbers are generated at every step, for example, if the digits along the path are `1, 9, 1`, then there will be three numbers generated along the way: `1, 19, 191`.


Return _the most frequent <span data-keyword="prime-number">prime number *greater* than _`10`_ out of all the numbers created by traversing the matrix or _`-1`_ if no such prime number exists. If there are multiple prime numbers with the highest frequency, then return the *largest* among them._

*Note:* It is invalid to change the direction during the move.

Input:* mat = [[1,1],[9,9],[1,1]]
*Output:* 19
*Explanation:* 
From cell (0,0) there are 3 possible directions and the numbers greater than 10 which can be created in those directions are:
East: [11], South-East: [19], South: [19,191].
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (0,1) in all possible directions are: [19,191,19,11].
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,0) in all possible directions are: [99,91,91,91,91].
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,1) in all possible directions are: [91,91,99,91,91].
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,0) in all possible directions are: [11,19,191,19].
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,1) in all possible directions are: [11,19,19,191].
The most frequent prime number among all the created numbers is 19.

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* mat = [[7]]
*Output:* -1
*Explanation:* The only number which can be formed is 7. It is a prime number however it is not greater than 10, so return -1.

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* mat = [[9,7,8],[4,6,5],[2,8,6]]
*Output:* 97
*Explanation:* 
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (0,0) in all possible directions are: [97,978,96,966,94,942].
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (0,1) in all possible directions are: [78,75,76,768,74,79].
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (0,2) in all possible directions are: [85,856,86,862,87,879].
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,0) in all possible directions are: [46,465,48,42,49,47].
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,1) in all possible directions are: [65,66,68,62,64,69,67,68].
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,2) in all possible directions are: [56,58,56,564,57,58].
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,0) in all possible directions are: [28,286,24,249,26,268].
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,1) in all possible directions are: [86,82,84,86,867,85].
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,2) in all possible directions are: [68,682,66,669,65,658].
The most frequent prime number among all the created numbers is 97.

*Constraints:*


* `m == mat.length`
* `n == mat[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 6`
* `1 <= mat[i][j] <= 9`
