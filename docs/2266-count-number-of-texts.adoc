https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-texts/[LeetCode - 2266. Count Number of Texts ^]

Alice is texting Bob using her phone. The *mapping* of digits to letters is shown in the figure below.
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/15/1200px-telephone-keypad2svg.png" style="width: 200px; height: 162px;" />
In order to *add* a letter, Alice has to *press* the key of the corresponding digit `i` times, where `i` is the position of the letter in the key.


* For example, to add the letter `'s'`, Alice has to press `'7'` four times. Similarly, to add the letter `'k'`, Alice has to press `'5'` twice.
* Note that the digits `'0'` and `'1'` do not map to any letters, so Alice *does not* use them.


However, due to an error in transmission, Bob did not receive Alice's text message but received a *string of pressed keys* instead.


* For example, when Alice sent the message `"bob"`, Bob received the string `"2266622"`.


Given a string `pressedKeys` representing the string received by Bob, return _the *total number of possible text messages* Alice could have sent_.

Since the answer may be very large, return it *modulo* `10^9^ + 7`.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* pressedKeys = "22233"
*Output:* 8
*Explanation:*
The possible text messages Alice could have sent are:
"aaadd", "abdd", "badd", "cdd", "aaae", "abe", "bae", and "ce".
Since there are 8 possible messages, we return 8.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* pressedKeys = "222222222222222222222222222222222222"
*Output:* 82876089
*Explanation:*
There are 2082876103 possible text messages Alice could have sent.
Since we need to return the answer modulo 10^9^ + 7, we return 2082876103 % (10^9^ + 7) = 82876089.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= pressedKeys.length <= 10^5^`
* `pressedKeys` only consists of digits from `'2'` - `'9'`.
