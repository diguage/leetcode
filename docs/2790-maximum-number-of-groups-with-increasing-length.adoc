= 2790. Maximum Number of Groups With Increasing Length

{leetcode}/problems/maximum-number-of-groups-with-increasing-length/[LeetCode - 2790. Maximum Number of Groups With Increasing Length ^]

You are given a *0-indexed* array `usageLimits` of length `n`.

Your task is to create *groups* using numbers from `0` to `n - 1`, ensuring that each number, `i`, is used no more than `usageLimits[i]` times in total *across all groups*. You must also satisfy the following conditions:


* Each group must consist of *distinct *numbers, meaning that no duplicate numbers are allowed within a single group.
* Each group (except the first one) must have a length *strictly greater* than the previous group.


Return _an integer denoting the *maximum* number of groups you can create while satisfying these conditions._

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* `usageLimits` = [1,2,5]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* In this example, we can use 0 at most once, 1 at most twice, and 2 at most five times.
One way of creating the maximum number of groups while satisfying the conditions is: 
Group 1 contains the number [2].
Group 2 contains the numbers [1,2].
Group 3 contains the numbers [0,1,2]. 
It can be shown that the maximum number of groups is 3. 
So, the output is 3. ----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* `usageLimits` = [2,1,2]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* In this example, we can use 0 at most twice, 1 at most once, and 2 at most twice.
One way of creating the maximum number of groups while satisfying the conditions is:
Group 1 contains the number [0].
Group 2 contains the numbers [1,2].
It can be shown that the maximum number of groups is 2.
So, the output is 2. 
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* `usageLimits` = [1,1]
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* In this example, we can use both 0 and 1 at most once.
One way of creating the maximum number of groups while satisfying the conditions is:
Group 1 contains the number [0].
It can be shown that the maximum number of groups is 1.
So, the output is 1. 
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= usageLimits.length <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= usageLimits[i] <= 10^9^`
