= 327. Count of Range Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-range-sum/[LeetCode - Count of Range Sum]

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of range sums that lie in `[lower, upper]` inclusive.


Range sum `S(i, j)` is defined as the sum of the elements in `nums` between indices `i` and `j` (`i` â‰¤ `j`), inclusive.

*Note:*


A naive algorithm of _O_(_n_^2^) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.

*Example:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* _nums_ = `[-2,5,-1]`, _lower_ = `-2`, _upper_ = `2`,
*Output:* 3 
*Explanation:* The three ranges are : `[0,0]`, `[2,2]`, `[0,2]` and their respective sums are: `-2, -1, 2`.
