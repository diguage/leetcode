= 830. Positions of Large Groups

https://leetcode.com/problems/positions-of-large-groups/[LeetCode - Positions of Large Groups]

In a string `S` of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.

For example, a string like `S = "abbxxxxzyy"` has the groups `"a"`, `"bb"`, `"xxxx"`, `"z"` and `"yy"`.

Call a group _large_ if it has 3 or more characters.  We would like the starting and ending positions of every large group.

The final answer should be in lexicographic order.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* "abbxxxxzzy"
*Output:* [[3,6]]
*Explanation:* `"xxxx" is the single `large group with starting  3 and ending positions 6.

----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* "abc"
*Output:* []
*Explanation*: We have "a","b" and "c" but no large group.

----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd"
*Output:* [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]
----

 

*Note: * `1 <= S.length <= 1000`
