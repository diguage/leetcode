= 1598. Crawler Log Folder

https://leetcode.com/problems/crawler-log-folder/[LeetCode - 1598. Crawler Log Folder ^]

The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a _change folder_ operation.

The operations are described below:


* `"../"` : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, *remain in the same folder*).
* `"./"` : Remain in the same folder.
* `"x/"` : Move to the child folder named `x` (This folder is *guaranteed to always exist*).


You are given a list of strings `logs` where `logs[i]` is the operation performed by the user at the `i^th^` step.

The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in `logs` are performed.

Return _the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations._
