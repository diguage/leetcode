https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/[LeetCode - House Robber II]

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are *arranged in a circle.* That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and *it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night*.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight *without alerting the police*.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [2,3,2]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
             because they are adjacent houses.

----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [1,2,3,1]
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
