https://leetcode.com/problems/group-the-people-given-the-group-size-they-belong-to/[LeetCode - Group the People Given the Group Size They Belong To]

There are `n` people whose *IDs* go from `0` to `n - 1` and each person belongs *exactly* to one group. Given the array `groupSizes` of length `n` telling the group size each person belongs to, return the groups there are and the people's *IDs* each group includes.

You can return any solution in any order and the same applies for IDs. Also, it is guaranteed that there exists at least one solution. 

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* groupSizes = [3,3,3,3,3,1,3]
*Output:* [[5],[0,1,2],[3,4,6]]
*Explanation:* 
Other possible solutions are [[2,1,6],[5],[0,4,3]] and [[5],[0,6,2],[4,3,1]].
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* groupSizes = [2,1,3,3,3,2]
*Output:* [[1],[0,5],[2,3,4]]
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `groupSizes.length == n`
* `1 <= n <= 500`
* `1 <= groupSizes[i] <= n`
