= 3014. Minimum Number of Pushes to Type Word I

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-pushes-to-type-word-i/[LeetCode - 3014. Minimum Number of Pushes to Type Word I ^]

You are given a string `word` containing *distinct* lowercase English letters.

Telephone keypads have keys mapped with *distinct* collections of lowercase English letters, which can be used to form words by pushing them. For example, the key `2` is mapped with `["a","b","c"]`, we need to push the key one time to type `"a"`, two times to type `"b"`, and three times to type `"c"` _._

It is allowed to remap the keys numbered `2` to `9` to *distinct* collections of letters. The keys can be remapped to *any* amount of letters, but each letter *must* be mapped to *exactly* one key. You need to find the *minimum* number of times the keys will be pushed to type the string `word`.

Return _the *minimum* number of pushes needed to type _`word` _after remapping the keys_.

An example mapping of letters to keys on a telephone keypad is given below. Note that `1`, `*`, `#`, and `0` do *not* map to any letters.

*Input:* word = "abcde"
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
"a" -> one push on key 2
"b" -> one push on key 3
"c" -> one push on key 4
"d" -> one push on key 5
"e" -> one push on key 6
Total cost is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.
It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.

*Input:* word = "xycdefghij"
*Output:* 12
*Explanation:* The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
"x" -> one push on key 2
"y" -> two pushes on key 2
"c" -> one push on key 3
"d" -> two pushes on key 3
"e" -> one push on key 4
"f" -> one push on key 5
"g" -> one push on key 6
"h" -> one push on key 7
"i" -> one push on key 8
"j" -> one push on key 9
Total cost is 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12.
It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= word.length <= 26`
* `word` consists of lowercase English letters.
* All letters in `word` are distinct.
