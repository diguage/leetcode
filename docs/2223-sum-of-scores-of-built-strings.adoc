{leetcode}/problems/sum-of-scores-of-built-strings/[LeetCode - 2223. Sum of Scores of Built Strings ^]

You are *building* a string `s` of length `n` *one* character at a time, *prepending* each new character to the *front* of the string. The strings are labeled from `1` to `n`, where the string with length `i` is labeled `s<sub>i</sub>`.


* For example, for `s = "abaca"`, `s<sub>1</sub> == "a"`, `s<sub>2</sub> == "ca"`, `s<sub>3</sub> == "aca"`, etc.


The *score* of `s<sub>i</sub>` is the length of the *longest common prefix* between `s<sub>i</sub>` and `s<sub>n</sub>` (Note that `s == s<sub>n</sub>`).

Given the final string `s`, return_ the *sum* of the *score* of every _`s<sub>i</sub>`.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "babab"
*Output:* 9
*Explanation:*
For s<sub>1</sub> == "b", the longest common prefix is "b" which has a score of 1.
For s<sub>2</sub> == "ab", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.
For s<sub>3</sub> == "bab", the longest common prefix is "bab" which has a score of 3.
For s<sub>4</sub> == "abab", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.
For s<sub>5</sub> == "babab", the longest common prefix is "babab" which has a score of 5.
The sum of the scores is 1 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 5 = 9, so we return 9.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "azbazbzaz"
*Output:* 14
*Explanation:* 
For s<sub>2</sub> == "az", the longest common prefix is "az" which has a score of 2.
For s<sub>6</sub> == "azbzaz", the longest common prefix is "azb" which has a score of 3.
For s<sub>9</sub> == "azbazbzaz", the longest common prefix is "azbazbzaz" which has a score of 9.
For all other s<sub>i</sub>, the score is 0.
The sum of the scores is 2 + 3 + 9 = 14, so we return 14.

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5^`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
