D瓜哥的思路：先找出一条从根节点到某个节点的路径；然后从这条路径上以此去寻找另外一个节点。找到这返回此节点。

思考题：如何按照"路径"的思路实现一遍？

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor[definition of LCA on Wikipedia]: &ldquo;The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow *a node to be a descendant of itself*).&rdquo;

Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* The LCA of nodes `5` and `1` is `3.`
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* The LCA of nodes `5` and `4` is `5`, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
----

 

*Note:*


* All of the nodes' values will be unique.
* p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.
