== 906. Super Palindromes

https://leetcode.com/problems/super-palindromes/[LeetCode - Super Palindromes]

Let's say a positive integer is a _superpalindrome_ if it is a palindrome, and it is also the square of a palindrome.

Now, given two positive integers `L` and `R` (represented as strings), return the number of superpalindromes in the inclusive range `[L, R]`.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* L = "4", R = "1000"
*Output:* 4
*Explanation*: 4, 9, 121, and 484 are superpalindromes.
Note that 676 is not a superpalindrome: 26 * 26 = 676, but 26 is not a palindrome.
----

 

*Note:*


. `1 <= len(L) <= 18`
. `1 <= len(R) <= 18`
. `L` and `R` are strings representing integers in the range `[1, 10^18)`.
. `int(L) <= int(R)`
