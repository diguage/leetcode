There is a street with `n * 2` *plots*, where there are `n` plots on each side of the street. The plots on each side are numbered from `1` to `n`. On each plot, a house can be placed.

Return _the number of ways houses can be placed such that no two houses are adjacent to each other on the same side of the street_. Since the answer may be very large, return it *modulo* `10^9^ + 7`.

Note that if a house is placed on the `i^th^` plot on one side of the street, a house can also be placed on the `i^th^` plot on the other side of the street.
