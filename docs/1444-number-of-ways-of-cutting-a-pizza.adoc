https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-of-cutting-a-pizza/[LeetCode - 1444. Number of Ways of Cutting a Pizza ^]

Given a rectangular pizza represented as a `rows x cols` matrix containing the following characters: `'A'` (an apple) and `'.'` (empty cell) and given the integer `k`. You have to cut the pizza into `k` pieces using `k-1` cuts. 

For each cut you choose the direction: vertical or horizontal, then you choose a cut position at the cell boundary and cut the pizza into two pieces. If you cut the pizza vertically, give the left part of the pizza to a person. If you cut the pizza horizontally, give the upper part of the pizza to a person. Give the last piece of pizza to the last person.

_Return the number of ways of cutting the pizza such that each piece contains *at least* one apple. _Since the answer can be a huge number, return this modulo 10^9 + 7.

*Constraints:*


* `1 <= rows, cols <= 50`
* `rows == pizza.length`
* `cols == pizza[i].length`
* `1 <= k <= 10`
* `pizza` consists of characters `'A'` and `'.'` only.
