https://leetcode.com/problems/long-pressed-name/[LeetCode - Long Pressed Name]

Your friend is typing his `name` into a keyboard.  Sometimes, when typing a character `c`, the key might get _long pressed_, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the `typed` characters of the keyboard.  Return `True` if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
*Output:* true
*Explanation:* 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
*Output:* false
*Explanation:* 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it wasn't in the typed output.
----


*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* name = "leelee", typed = "lleeelee"
*Output:* true
----


*Example 4:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* name = "laiden", typed = "laiden"
*Output:* true
*Explanation:* It's not necessary to long press any character.
----

 




*Note:*


. `name.length <= 1000`
. `typed.length <= 1000`
. The characters of `name` and `typed` are lowercase letters.
