= 764. Largest Plus Sign

https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-plus-sign/[LeetCode - Largest Plus Sign]


In a 2D `grid` from (0, 0) to (N-1, N-1), every cell contains a `1`, except those cells in the given list `mines` which are `0`.  What is the largest axis-aligned plus sign of `1`s contained in the grid?  Return the order of the plus sign.  If there is none, return 0.

An "_axis-aligned plus sign of `1`s_ of order *k*" has some center `grid[x][y] = 1` along with 4 arms of length `k-1` going up, down, left, and right, and made of `1`s.  This is demonstrated in the diagrams below.  Note that there could be `0`s or `1`s beyond the arms of the plus sign, only the relevant area of the plus sign is checked for 1s.


*Examples of Axis-Aligned Plus Signs of Order k:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
Order 1:
000
0*1*0
000

Order 2:
00000
00*1*00
0*111*0
00*1*00
00000

Order 3:
0000000
000*1*000
000*1*000
0*11111*0
000*1*000
000*1*000
0000000
----

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* N = 5, mines = [[4, 2]]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:*
11111
11111
1*1*111
*111*11
1*1*011
In the above grid, the largest plus sign can only be order 2.  One of them is marked in bold.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* N = 2, mines = []
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:*
There is no plus sign of order 2, but there is of order 1.
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* N = 1, mines = [[0, 0]]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:*
There is no plus sign, so return 0.
----

*Note:*
. `N` will be an integer in the range `[1, 500]`.
. `mines` will have length at most `5000`.
. `mines[i]` will be length 2 and consist of integers in the range `[0, N-1]`.
. _(Additionally, programs submitted in C, C++, or C# will be judged with a slightly smaller time limit.)_
