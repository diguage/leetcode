= 2226. Maximum Candies Allocated to K Children

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-candies-allocated-to-k-children/[LeetCode - 2226. Maximum Candies Allocated to K Children ^]

You are given a *0-indexed* integer array `candies`. Each element in the array denotes a pile of candies of size `candies[i]`. You can divide each pile into any number of *sub piles*, but you *cannot* merge two piles together.

You are also given an integer `k`. You should allocate piles of candies to `k` children such that each child gets the *same* number of candies. Each child can take *at most one* pile of candies and some piles of candies may go unused.

Return _the *maximum number of candies* each child can get._
 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* candies = [5,8,6], k = 3
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* We can divide candies[1] into 2 piles of size 5 and 3, and candies[2] into 2 piles of size 5 and 1. We now have five piles of candies of sizes 5, 5, 3, 5, and 1. We can allocate the 3 piles of size 5 to 3 children. It can be proven that each child cannot receive more than 5 candies.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* candies = [2,5], k = 11
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* There are 11 children but only 7 candies in total, so it is impossible to ensure each child receives at least one candy. Thus, each child gets no candy and the answer is 0.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= candies.length <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= candies[i] <= 10^7^`
* `1 <= k <= 10^12^`
