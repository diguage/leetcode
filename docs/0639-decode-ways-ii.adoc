== 639. Decode Ways II

https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways-ii/[LeetCode - Decode Ways II]


A message containing letters from `A-Z` is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping way:


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
----


Beyond that, now the encoded string can also contain the character '*', which can be treated as one of the numbers from 1 to 9.




Given the encoded message containing digits and the character '*', return the total number of ways to decode it.



Also, since the answer may be very large, you should return the output mod 10^9^ + 7.


*Example 1:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* "*"
*Output:* 9
*Explanation:* The encoded message can be decoded to the string: "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I".
----


*Example 2:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* "1*"
*Output:* 9 + 9 = 18
----


*Note:*<br>

. The length of the input string will fit in range [1, 10^5^].
. The input string will only contain the character '*' and digits '0' - '9'.
