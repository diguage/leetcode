== 260. Single Number III

https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/[LeetCode - Single Number III]

Given an array of numbers `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

*Example:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*  `[1,2,1,3,2,5]`
*Output:* `[3,5]`
----

*Note*:


. The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, `[5, 3]` is also correct.
. Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?
