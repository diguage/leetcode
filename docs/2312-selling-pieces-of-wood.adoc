{leetcode}/problems/selling-pieces-of-wood/[LeetCode - 2312. Selling Pieces of Wood ^]

You are given two integers `m` and `n` that represent the height and width of a rectangular piece of wood. You are also given a 2D integer array `prices`, where `prices[i] = [h<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>, price<sub>i</sub>]` indicates you can sell a rectangular piece of wood of height `h<sub>i</sub>` and width `w<sub>i</sub>` for `price<sub>i</sub>` dollars.

To cut a piece of wood, you must make a vertical or horizontal cut across the *entire* height or width of the piece to split it into two smaller pieces. After cutting a piece of wood into some number of smaller pieces, you can sell pieces according to `prices`. You may sell multiple pieces of the same shape, and you do not have to sell all the shapes. The grain of the wood makes a difference, so you *cannot* rotate a piece to swap its height and width.

Return _the *maximum* money you can earn after cutting an _`m x n`_ piece of wood_.

Note that you can cut the piece of wood as many times as you want.

*Input:* m = 3, n = 5, prices = [[1,4,2],[2,2,7],[2,1,3]]
*Output:* 19
*Explanation:* The diagram above shows a possible scenario. It consists of:
- 2 pieces of wood shaped 2 x 2, selling for a price of 2 * 7 = 14.
- 1 piece of wood shaped 2 x 1, selling for a price of 1 * 3 = 3.
- 1 piece of wood shaped 1 x 4, selling for a price of 1 * 2 = 2.
This obtains a total of 14 + 3 + 2 = 19 money earned.
It can be shown that 19 is the maximum amount of money that can be earned.

*Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/04/27/ex2new.png" style="width: 250px; height: 175px;" />

*Input:* m = 4, n = 6, prices = [[3,2,10],[1,4,2],[4,1,3]]
*Output:* 32
*Explanation:* The diagram above shows a possible scenario. It consists of:
- 3 pieces of wood shaped 3 x 2, selling for a price of 3 * 10 = 30.
- 1 piece of wood shaped 1 x 4, selling for a price of 1 * 2 = 2.
This obtains a total of 30 + 2 = 32 money earned.
It can be shown that 32 is the maximum amount of money that can be earned.
Notice that we cannot rotate the 1 x 4 piece of wood to obtain a 4 x 1 piece of wood.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= m, n <= 200`
* `1 <= prices.length <= 2 * 10^4^`
* `prices[i].length == 3`
* `1 <= h<sub>i</sub> <= m`
* `1 <= w<sub>i</sub> <= n`
* `1 <= price<sub>i</sub> <= 10^6^`
* All the shapes of wood `(h<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>)` are pairwise *distinct*.
