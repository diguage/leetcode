https://leetcode.com/problems/self-dividing-numbers/[LeetCode - Self Dividing Numbers]


A _self-dividing number_ is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because `128 % 1 == 0`, `128 % 2 == 0`, and `128 % 8 == 0`.

Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self dividing number, including the bounds if possible.

*Example 1:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* 
left = 1, right = 22
*Output:* [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]
----


*Note:*
. The boundaries of each input argument are `1 <= left <= right <= 10000`.</li>
