= 2382. Maximum Segment Sum After Removals

{leetcode}/problems/maximum-segment-sum-after-removals/[LeetCode - 2382. Maximum Segment Sum After Removals ^]

You are given two *0-indexed* integer arrays `nums` and `removeQueries`, both of length `n`. For the `i^th^` query, the element in `nums` at the index `removeQueries[i]` is removed, splitting `nums` into different segments.

A *segment* is a contiguous sequence of *positive* integers in `nums`. A *segment sum* is the sum of every element in a segment.

Return_ an integer array _`answer`_, of length _`n`_, where _`answer[i]`_ is the *maximum* segment sum after applying the _`i^th^` _removal._

*Note:* The same index will *not* be removed more than once.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [1,2,5,6,1], removeQueries = [0,3,2,4,1]
*Output:* [14,7,2,2,0]
*Explanation:* Using 0 to indicate a removed element, the answer is as follows:
Query 1: Remove the 0th element, nums becomes [0,2,5,6,1] and the maximum segment sum is 14 for segment [2,5,6,1].
Query 2: Remove the 3rd element, nums becomes [0,2,5,0,1] and the maximum segment sum is 7 for segment [2,5].
Query 3: Remove the 2nd element, nums becomes [0,2,0,0,1] and the maximum segment sum is 2 for segment [2]. 
Query 4: Remove the 4th element, nums becomes [0,2,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 2 for segment [2]. 
Query 5: Remove the 1st element, nums becomes [0,0,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 0, since there are no segments.
Finally, we return [14,7,2,2,0].
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [3,2,11,1], removeQueries = [3,2,1,0]
*Output:* [16,5,3,0]
*Explanation:* Using 0 to indicate a removed element, the answer is as follows:
Query 1: Remove the 3rd element, nums becomes [3,2,11,0] and the maximum segment sum is 16 for segment [3,2,11].
Query 2: Remove the 2nd element, nums becomes [3,2,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 5 for segment [3,2].
Query 3: Remove the 1st element, nums becomes [3,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 3 for segment [3].
Query 4: Remove the 0th element, nums becomes [0,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 0, since there are no segments.
Finally, we return [16,5,3,0].

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == nums.length == removeQueries.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9^`
* `0 <= removeQueries[i] < n`
* All the values of `removeQueries` are *unique*.
