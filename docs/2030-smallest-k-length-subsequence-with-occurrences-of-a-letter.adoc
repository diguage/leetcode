= 2030. Smallest K-Length Subsequence With Occurrences of a Letter

{leetcode}/problems/smallest-k-length-subsequence-with-occurrences-of-a-letter/[LeetCode - 2030. Smallest K-Length Subsequence With Occurrences of a Letter ^]

You are given a string `s`, an integer `k`, a letter `letter`, and an integer `repetition`.

Return _the *lexicographically smallest* subsequence of_ `s`_ of length_ `k` _that has the letter_ `letter` _appear *at least*_ `repetition` _times_. The test cases are generated so that the `letter` appears in `s` *at least* `repetition` times.

A *subsequence* is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

A string `a` is *lexicographically smaller* than a string `b` if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "leet", k = 3, letter = "e", repetition = 1
*Output:* "eet"
*Explanation:* There are four subsequences of length 3 that have the letter 'e' appear at least 1 time:
- "lee" (from "*[.underline]#lee#*t")
- "let" (from "*[.underline]#le#*e[.underline]#*t*#")
- "let" (from "[.underline]#*l*#e[.underline]#*et*#")
- "eet" (from "l[.underline]#*eet*#")
The lexicographically smallest subsequence among them is "eet".
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "leetcode", k = 4, letter = "e", repetition = 2
*Output:* "ecde"
*Explanation:* "ecde" is the lexicographically smallest subsequence of length 4 that has the letter "e" appear at least 2 times.
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "bb", k = 2, letter = "b", repetition = 2
*Output:* "bb"
*Explanation:* "bb" is the only subsequence of length 2 that has the letter "b" appear at least 2 times.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= repetition <= k <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4^`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
* `letter` is a lowercase English letter, and appears in `s` at least `repetition` times.
