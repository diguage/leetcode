= 1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit

{leetcode}/problems/longest-continuous-subarray-with-absolute-diff-less-than-or-equal-to-limit/[LeetCode - 1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit ^]

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `limit`, return the size of the longest *non-empty* subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to `limit`_._

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
*Output:* 2 
*Explanation:* All subarrays are: 
[8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.
[8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4. 
[8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.
[2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.
[2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.
[4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.
[4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.
[7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4. 
Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5
*Output:* 4 
*Explanation:* The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 <= 5.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0
*Output:* 3
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9^`
* `0 <= limit <= 10^9^`
