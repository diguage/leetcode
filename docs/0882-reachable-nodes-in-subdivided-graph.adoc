= 882. Reachable Nodes In Subdivided Graph

{leetcode}/problems/reachable-nodes-in-subdivided-graph/[LeetCode - Reachable Nodes In Subdivided Graph^]

Starting with an *undirected* graph (the "original graph") with nodes from `0` to `N-1`, subdivisions are made to some of the edges.

The graph is given as follows: `edges[k]` is a list of integer pairs `(i, j, n)` such that `(i, j)` is an edge of the original graph,

and `n` is the total number of *new* nodes on that edge. 

Then, the edge `(i, j)` is deleted from the original graph, `n` new nodes `(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)` are added to the original graph,

and `n+1` new edges `(i, x_1), (x_1, x_2), (x_2, x_3), ..., (x_{n-1}, x_n), (x_n, j)` are added to the original graph.

Now, you start at node `0` from the original graph, and in each move, you travel along one edge. 

Return how many nodes you can reach in at most `M` moves.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* `edges `= [[0,1,10],[0,2,1],[1,2,2]], M = 6, N = 3
*Output:* 13
*Explanation:*
The nodes that are reachable in the final graph after M = 6 moves are indicated below.

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* `edges `= [[0,1,4],[1,2,6],[0,2,8],[1,3,1]], M = 10, N = 4
*Output:* 23
----

 


*Note:*


. `0 <= edges.length <= 10000`
. `0 <= edges[i][0] < edges[i][1] < N`
. There does not exist any `i != j` for which `edges[i][0] == edges[j][0]` and `edges[i][1] == edges[j][1]`.
. The original graph has no parallel edges.
. `0 <= edges[i][2] <= 10000`
. `0 <= M <= 10^9`
. `<font face="monospace">1 <= N <= 3000`
. A reachable node is a node that can be travelled to using at most M moves starting from node 0.
