= 2201. Count Artifacts That Can Be Extracted

{leetcode}/problems/count-artifacts-that-can-be-extracted/[LeetCode - 2201. Count Artifacts That Can Be Extracted ^]

There is an `n x n` *0-indexed* grid with some artifacts buried in it. You are given the integer `n` and a *0-indexed *2D integer array `artifacts` describing the positions of the rectangular artifacts where `artifacts[i] = [r1<sub>i</sub>, c1<sub>i</sub>, r2<sub>i</sub>, c2<sub>i</sub>]` denotes that the `i^th^` artifact is buried in the subgrid where:


* `(r1<sub>i</sub>, c1<sub>i</sub>)` is the coordinate of the *top-left* cell of the `i^th^` artifact and
* `(r2<sub>i</sub>, c2<sub>i</sub>)` is the coordinate of the *bottom-right* cell of the `i^th^` artifact.


You will excavate some cells of the grid and remove all the mud from them. If the cell has a part of an artifact buried underneath, it will be uncovered. If all the parts of an artifact are uncovered, you can extract it.

Given a *0-indexed* 2D integer array `dig` where `dig[i] = [r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>]` indicates that you will excavate the cell `(r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>)`, return _the number of artifacts that you can extract_.

The test cases are generated such that:


* No two artifacts overlap.
* Each artifact only covers at most `4` cells.
* The entries of `dig` are unique.


 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/16/untitled-diagram.jpg" style="width: 216px; height: 216px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 2, artifacts = [[0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1]], dig = [[0,0],[0,1]]
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* 
The different colors represent different artifacts. Excavated cells are labeled with a 'D' in the grid.
There is 1 artifact that can be extracted, namely the red artifact.
The blue artifact has one part in cell (1,1) which remains uncovered, so we cannot extract it.
Thus, we return 1.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/16/untitled-diagram-1.jpg" style="width: 216px; height: 216px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 2, artifacts = [[0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1]], dig = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,1]]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* Both the red and blue artifacts have all parts uncovered (labeled with a 'D') and can be extracted, so we return 2. 
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 1000`
* `1 <= artifacts.length, dig.length <= min(n^2^, 10^5^)`
* `artifacts[i].length == 4`
* `dig[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= r1<sub>i</sub>, c1<sub>i</sub>, r2<sub>i</sub>, c2<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub> <= n - 1`
* `r1<sub>i</sub> <= r2<sub>i</sub>`
* `c1<sub>i</sub> <= c2<sub>i</sub>`
* No two artifacts will overlap.
* The number of cells covered by an artifact is *at most* `4`.
* The entries of `dig` are unique.
