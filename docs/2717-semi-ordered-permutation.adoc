https://leetcode.com/problems/semi-ordered-permutation/[LeetCode - 2717. Semi-Ordered Permutation ^]

You are given a *0-indexed* permutation of `n` integers `nums`.

A permutation is called *semi-ordered* if the first number equals `1` and the last number equals `n`. You can perform the below operation as many times as you want until you make `nums` a *semi-ordered* permutation:


* Pick two adjacent elements in `nums`, then swap them.


Return _the minimum number of operations to make _`nums`_ a *semi-ordered permutation*_.

A *permutation* is a sequence of integers from `1` to `n` of length `n` containing each number exactly once.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [2,1,4,3]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* We can make the permutation semi-ordered using these sequence of operations: 
1 - swap i = 0 and j = 1. The permutation becomes [1,2,4,3].
2 - swap i = 2 and j = 3. The permutation becomes [1,2,3,4].
It can be proved that there is no sequence of less than two operations that make nums a semi-ordered permutation. 
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [2,4,1,3]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* We can make the permutation semi-ordered using these sequence of operations:
1 - swap i = 1 and j = 2. The permutation becomes [2,1,4,3].
2 - swap i = 0 and j = 1. The permutation becomes [1,2,4,3].
3 - swap i = 2 and j = 3. The permutation becomes [1,2,3,4].
It can be proved that there is no sequence of less than three operations that make nums a semi-ordered permutation.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [1,3,4,2,5]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* The permutation is already a semi-ordered permutation.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `2 <= nums.length == n <= 50`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 50`
* `nums is a permutation.`
