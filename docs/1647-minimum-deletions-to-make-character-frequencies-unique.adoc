= 1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique

{leetcode}/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique/[LeetCode - 1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique ^]

A string `s` is called *good* if there are no two different characters in `s` that have the same *frequency*.

Given a string `s`, return_ the *minimum* number of characters you need to delete to make _`s`_ *good*._

The *frequency* of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string `"aab"`, the *frequency* of `'a'` is `2`, while the *frequency* of `'b'` is `1`.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "aab"
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* `s` is already good.

----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "aaabbbcc"
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* You can delete two 'b's resulting in the good string "aaabcc".
Another way it to delete one 'b' and one 'c' resulting in the good string "aaabbc".
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "ceabaacb"
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* You can delete both 'c's resulting in the good string "eabaab".
Note that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the end (i.e. frequency of 0 is ignored).

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5^`
* `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
