https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/[LeetCode - Rotting Oranges]

In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values:


* the value `0` representing an empty cell;
* the value `1` representing a fresh orange;
* the value `2` representing a rotten orange.


Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.  If this is impossible, return `-1` instead.

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
*Output:* 4
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
*Output:* -1
*Explanation:* The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
----


*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [[0,2]]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
----

 

*Note:*


* `1 <= grid.length <= 10`
* `1 <= grid[0].length <= 10`
* `grid[i][j]` is only `0`, `1`, or `2`.
