== 187. Repeated DNA Sequences

https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/[LeetCode - Repeated DNA Sequences]

All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

*Example:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"

*Output:* ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]
----
