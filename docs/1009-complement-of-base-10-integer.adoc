= 1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer

{leetcode}/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/[LeetCode - Complement of Base 10 Integer^]

Every non-negative integer `N` has a binary representation.  For example, `5` can be represented as `"101"` in binary, `11` as `"1011"` in binary, and so on.  Note that except for `N = 0`, there are no leading zeroes in any binary representation.

The _complement_ of a binary representation is the number in binary you get when changing every `1` to a `0` and `0` to a `1`.  For example, the complement of `"101"` in binary is `"010"` in binary.

For a given number `N` in base-10, return the complement of it's binary representation as a base-10 integer.

 





*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* 5
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* 7
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.
----


*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* 10
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.
----

 

*Note:*


. `0 <= N < 10^9`
