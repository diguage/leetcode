== 275. H-Index II

https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index-ii/[LeetCode - H-Index II]

Given an array of citations *sorted in ascending order *(each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index[definition of h-index on Wikipedia]: "A scientist has index _h_ if _h_ of his/her _N_ papers have *at least* _h_ citations each, and the other _N - h_ papers have *no more than* _h _citations each."

*Example:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* `citations = [0,1,3,5,6]`
*Output:* 3 
*Explanation:* `[0,1,3,5,6] `means the researcher has `5` papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0`, 1, 3, 5, 6` citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has `3` papers with *at least* `3` citations each and the remaining 
             two with *no more than* `3` citations each, her h-index is `3`.
----

*Note:*

If there are several possible values for _h_, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

*Follow up:*


* This is a follow up problem to <a href="/problems/h-index/description/">H-Index</a>, where `citations` is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
* Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
