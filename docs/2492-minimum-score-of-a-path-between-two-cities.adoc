= 2492. Minimum Score of a Path Between Two Cities

{leetcode}/problems/minimum-score-of-a-path-between-two-cities/[LeetCode - 2492. Minimum Score of a Path Between Two Cities ^]

You are given a positive integer `n` representing `n` cities numbered from `1` to `n`. You are also given a *2D* array `roads` where `roads[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, distance<sub>i</sub>]` indicates that there is a *bidirectional *road between cities `a<sub>i</sub>` and `b<sub>i</sub>` with a distance equal to `distance<sub>i</sub>`. The cities graph is not necessarily connected.

The *score* of a path between two cities is defined as the *minimum *distance of a road in this path.

Return _the *minimum *possible score of a path between cities _`1`_ and _`n`.

*Note*:


* A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.
* It is allowed for a path to contain the same road *multiple* times, and you can visit cities `1` and `n` multiple times along the path.
* The test cases are generated such that there is *at least* one path between `1` and `n`.


 
*Example 1:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/12/graph11.png" style="width: 190px; height: 231px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 4, roads = [[1,2,9],[2,3,6],[2,4,5],[1,4,7]]
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 4. The score of this path is min(9,5) = 5.
It can be shown that no other path has less score.
----

*Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/12/graph22.png" style="width: 190px; height: 231px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 4, roads = [[1,2,2],[1,3,4],[3,4,7]]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4. The score of this path is min(2,2,4,7) = 2.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `2 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= roads.length <= 10^5^`
* `roads[i].length == 3`
* `1 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> <= n`
* `a<sub>i</sub> != b<sub>i</sub>`
* `1 <= distance<sub>i</sub> <= 10^4^`
* There are no repeated edges.
* There is at least one path between `1` and `n`.
