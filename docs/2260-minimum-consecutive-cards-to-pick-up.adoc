{leetcode}/problems/minimum-consecutive-cards-to-pick-up/[LeetCode - 2260. Minimum Consecutive Cards to Pick Up ^]

You are given an integer array `cards` where `cards[i]` represents the *value* of the `i^th^` card. A pair of cards are *matching* if the cards have the *same* value.

Return_ the *minimum* number of *consecutive* cards you have to pick up to have a pair of *matching* cards among the picked cards._ If it is impossible to have matching cards, return `-1`.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* cards = [3,4,2,3,4,7]
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* We can pick up the cards [3,4,2,3] which contain a matching pair of cards with value 3. Note that picking up the cards [4,2,3,4] is also optimal.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* cards = [1,0,5,3]
*Output:* -1
*Explanation:* There is no way to pick up a set of consecutive cards that contain a pair of matching cards.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= cards.length <= 10^5^`
* `0 <= cards[i] <= 10^6^`
