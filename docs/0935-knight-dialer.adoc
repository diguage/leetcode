This time, we place our chess knight on any numbered key of a phone pad (indicated above), and the knight makes `N-1` hops.  Each hop must be from one key to another numbered key.

Each time it lands on a key (including the initial placement of the knight), it presses the number of that key, pressing `N` digits total.

How many distinct numbers can you dial in this manner?

Since the answer may be large, *output the answer modulo `10^9 + 7`*.
