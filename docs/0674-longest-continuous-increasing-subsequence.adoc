= 674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/[LeetCode - Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence]


Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest `continuous` increasing subsequence (subarray).


*Example 1:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [1,3,5,4,7]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
----


*Example 2:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [2,2,2,2,2]
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 
----


*Note:*
Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.
