= 1293. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination

https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/[LeetCode - Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination]

Given a `m * n` grid, where each cell is either `0` (empty) or `1` (obstacle). In one step, you can move up, down, left or right from and to an empty cell.

Return the minimum number of steps to walk from the upper left corner `(0, 0)` to the lower right corner `(m-1, n-1)` given that you can eliminate *at most* `k` obstacles. If it is not possible to find such walk return -1.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* 
grid = 
[[0,0,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,0],
 [0,1,1],
 [0,0,0]], 
k = 1
*Output:* 6
*Explanation: 
*The shortest path without eliminating any obstacle is 10. 
The shortest path with one obstacle elimination at position (3,2) is 6. Such path is `(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> *(3,2)* -> (4,2)`.

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* 
grid = 
[[0,1,1],
 [1,1,1],
 [1,0,0]], 
k = 1
*Output:* -1
*Explanation: 
*We need to eliminate at least two obstacles to find such a walk.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `grid.length == m`
* `grid[0].length == n`
* `1 <= m, n <= 40`
* `1 <= k <= m*n`
* `grid[i][j] == 0 *or* 1`
* `grid[0][0] == grid[m-1][n-1] == 0`
