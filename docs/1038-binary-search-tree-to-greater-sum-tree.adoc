= 1038. Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/[LeetCode - Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree]

Given the root of a binary *search* tree with distinct values, modify it so that every `node` has a new value equal to the sum of the values of the original tree that are greater than or equal to `node.val`.

As a reminder, a _binary search tree_ is a tree that satisfies these constraints:


* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys *less than* the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys *greater than* the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.


 

*Example 1:*

*Input:* [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
*Output:* [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]

*Note:*


* The number of nodes in the tree is between `1` and `100`.
* Each node will have value between `0` and `100`.
* The given tree is a binary search tree.
