= 2056. Number of Valid Move Combinations On Chessboard

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-valid-move-combinations-on-chessboard/[LeetCode - 2056. Number of Valid Move Combinations On Chessboard ^]

There is an `8 x 8` chessboard containing `n` pieces (rooks, queens, or bishops). You are given a string array `pieces` of length `n`, where `pieces[i]` describes the type (rook, queen, or bishop) of the `i^th^` piece. In addition, you are given a 2D integer array `positions` also of length `n`, where `positions[i] = [r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>]` indicates that the `i^th^` piece is currently at the *1-based* coordinate `(r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>)` on the chessboard.

When making a *move* for a piece, you choose a *destination* square that the piece will travel toward and stop on.


* A rook can only travel *horizontally or vertically* from `(r, c)` to the direction of `(r+1, c)`, `(r-1, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, or `(r, c-1)`.
* A queen can only travel *horizontally, vertically, or diagonally* from `(r, c)` to the direction of `(r+1, c)`, `(r-1, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, `(r, c-1)`, `(r+1, c+1)`, `(r+1, c-1)`, `(r-1, c+1)`, `(r-1, c-1)`.
* A bishop can only travel *diagonally* from `(r, c)` to the direction of `(r+1, c+1)`, `(r+1, c-1)`, `(r-1, c+1)`, `(r-1, c-1)`.


You must make a *move* for every piece on the board simultaneously. A *move combination* consists of all the *moves* performed on all the given pieces. Every second, each piece will instantaneously travel *one square* towards their destination if they are not already at it. All pieces start traveling at the `0^th^` second. A move combination is *invalid* if, at a given time, *two or more* pieces occupy the same square.

Return _the number of *valid* move combinations_​​​​​.

*Notes:*


* *No two pieces* will start in the* same* square.
* You may choose the square a piece is already on as its *destination*.
* If two pieces are *directly adjacent* to each other, it is valid for them to *move past each other* and swap positions in one second.

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* pieces = ["queen"], positions = [[1,1]]
*Output:* 22
*Explanation:* The image above shows the possible squares the piece can move to.

<strong class="example">Example 3:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/23/a3.png" style="width: 214px; height: 215px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* pieces = ["bishop"], positions = [[4,3]]
*Output:* 12
*Explanation:* The image above shows the possible squares the piece can move to.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == pieces.length `
* `n == positions.length`
* `1 <= n <= 4`
* `pieces` only contains the strings `"rook"`, `"queen"`, and `"bishop"`.
* There will be at most one queen on the chessboard.
* `1 <= x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub> <= 8`
* Each `positions[i]` is distinct.
