{leetcode}/problems/intervals-between-identical-elements/[LeetCode - 2121. Intervals Between Identical Elements ^]

You are given a *0-indexed* array of `n` integers `arr`.

The *interval* between two elements in `arr` is defined as the *absolute difference* between their indices. More formally, the *interval* between `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is `|i - j|`.

Return _an array_ `intervals` _of length_ `n` _where_ `intervals[i]` _is *the sum of intervals* between _`arr[i]`_ and each element in _`arr`_ with the same value as _`arr[i]`_._

*Note:* `|x|` is the absolute value of `x`.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* arr = [2,1,3,1,2,3,3]
*Output:* [4,2,7,2,4,4,5]
*Explanation:*
- Index 0: Another 2 is found at index 4. |0 - 4| = 4
- Index 1: Another 1 is found at index 3. |1 - 3| = 2
- Index 2: Two more 3s are found at indices 5 and 6. |2 - 5| + |2 - 6| = 7
- Index 3: Another 1 is found at index 1. |3 - 1| = 2
- Index 4: Another 2 is found at index 0. |4 - 0| = 4
- Index 5: Two more 3s are found at indices 2 and 6. |5 - 2| + |5 - 6| = 4
- Index 6: Two more 3s are found at indices 2 and 5. |6 - 2| + |6 - 5| = 5
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* arr = [10,5,10,10]
*Output:* [5,0,3,4]
*Explanation:*
- Index 0: Two more 10s are found at indices 2 and 3. |0 - 2| + |0 - 3| = 5
- Index 1: There is only one 5 in the array, so its sum of intervals to identical elements is 0.
- Index 2: Two more 10s are found at indices 0 and 3. |2 - 0| + |2 - 3| = 3
- Index 3: Two more 10s are found at indices 0 and 2. |3 - 0| + |3 - 2| = 4
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == arr.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5^`
