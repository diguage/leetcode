= 1326. Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-taps-to-open-to-water-a-garden/[LeetCode - Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden]

There is a one-dimensional garden on the x-axis. The garden starts at the point `0` and ends at the point `n`. (i.e The length of the garden is `n`).

There are `n + 1` taps located at points `[0, 1, ..., n]` in the garden.

Given an integer `n` and an integer array `ranges` of length `n + 1` where `ranges[i]` (0-indexed) means the `i-th` tap can water the area `[i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]]` if it was open.

Return _the minimum number of taps_ that should be open to water the whole garden, If the garden cannot be watered return *-1*.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 5, ranges = [3,4,1,1,0,0]
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* The tap at point 0 can cover the interval [-3,3]
The tap at point 1 can cover the interval [-3,5]
The tap at point 2 can cover the interval [1,3]
The tap at point 3 can cover the interval [2,4]
The tap at point 4 can cover the interval [4,4]
The tap at point 5 can cover the interval [5,5]
Opening Only the second tap will water the whole garden [0,5]

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 3, ranges = [0,0,0,0]
*Output:* -1
*Explanation:* Even if you activate all the four taps you cannot water the whole garden.

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 7, ranges = [1,2,1,0,2,1,0,1]
*Output:* 3
----

*Example 4:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 8, ranges = [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]
*Output:* 2
----

*Example 5:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 8, ranges = [4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,4]
*Output:* 1
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 10^4`
* `ranges.length == n + 1`
* `0 <= ranges[i] <= 100`
