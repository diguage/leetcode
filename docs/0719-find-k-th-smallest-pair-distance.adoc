== 719. Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-th-smallest-pair-distance/[LeetCode - Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance]

Given an integer array, return the k-th smallest *distance* among all the pairs. The distance of a pair (A, B) is defined as the absolute difference between A and B. 

*Example 1:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*
nums = [1,3,1]
k = 1
*Output: 0* 
*Explanation:*
Here are all the pairs:
(1,3) -> 2
(1,1) -> 0
(3,1) -> 2
Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.

*Note:*

. `2 <= len(nums) <= 10000`.
. `0 <= nums[i] < 1000000`.
. `1 <= k <= len(nums) * (len(nums) - 1) / 2`.
