= 2940. Find Building Where Alice and Bob Can Meet

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-building-where-alice-and-bob-can-meet/[LeetCode - 2940. Find Building Where Alice and Bob Can Meet ^]

You are given a *0-indexed* array `heights` of positive integers, where `heights[i]` represents the height of the `i^th^` building.

If a person is in building `i`, they can move to any other building `j` if and only if `i < j` and `heights[i] < heights[j]`.

You are also given another array `queries` where `queries[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]`. On the `i^th^` query, Alice is in building `a<sub>i</sub>` while Bob is in building `b<sub>i</sub>`.

Return _an array_ `ans` _where_ `ans[i]` _is *the index of the leftmost building* where Alice and Bob can meet on the_ `i^th^` _query_. _If Alice and Bob cannot move to a common building on query_ `i`, _set_ `ans[i]` _to_ `-1`.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* heights = [6,4,8,5,2,7], queries = [[0,1],[0,3],[2,4],[3,4],[2,2]]
*Output:* [2,5,-1,5,2]
*Explanation:* In the first query, Alice and Bob can move to building 2 since heights[0] < heights[2] and heights[1] < heights[2]. 
In the second query, Alice and Bob can move to building 5 since heights[0] < heights[5] and heights[3] < heights[5]. 
In the third query, Alice cannot meet Bob since Alice cannot move to any other building.
In the fourth query, Alice and Bob can move to building 5 since heights[3] < heights[5] and heights[4] < heights[5].
In the fifth query, Alice and Bob are already in the same building.  
For ans[i] != -1, It can be shown that ans[i] is the leftmost building where Alice and Bob can meet.
For ans[i] == -1, It can be shown that there is no building where Alice and Bob can meet.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* heights = [5,3,8,2,6,1,4,6], queries = [[0,7],[3,5],[5,2],[3,0],[1,6]]
*Output:* [7,6,-1,4,6]
*Explanation:* In the first query, Alice can directly move to Bob's building since heights[0] < heights[7].
In the second query, Alice and Bob can move to building 6 since heights[3] < heights[6] and heights[5] < heights[6].
In the third query, Alice cannot meet Bob since Bob cannot move to any other building.
In the fourth query, Alice and Bob can move to building 4 since heights[3] < heights[4] and heights[0] < heights[4].
In the fifth query, Alice can directly move to Bob's building since heights[1] < heights[6].
For ans[i] != -1, It can be shown that ans[i] is the leftmost building where Alice and Bob can meet.
For ans[i] == -1, It can be shown that there is no building where Alice and Bob can meet.

*Constraints:*


* `1 <= heights.length <= 5 * 10^4^`
* `1 <= heights[i] <= 10^9^`
* `1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 10^4^`
* `queries[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]`
* `0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> <= heights.length - 1`
