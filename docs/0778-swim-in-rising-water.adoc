https://leetcode.com/problems/swim-in-rising-water/[LeetCode - Swim in Rising Water^]

On an N x N `grid`, each square `grid[i][j]` represents the elevation at that point `(i,j)`.

Now rain starts to fall. At time `t`, the depth of the water everywhere is `t`. You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most `t`. You can swim infinite distance in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

You start at the top left square `(0, 0)`. What is the least time until you can reach the bottom right square `(N-1, N-1)`?

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [[0,2],[1,3]]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:*
At time `0`, you are in grid location `(0, 0)`.
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.

You cannot reach point `(1, 1)` until time `3`.
When the depth of water is `3`, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
*Output:* 16
*Explanation:*
* 0  1  2  3  4*
24 23 22 21  *5*
*12 13 14 15 16*
*11* 17 18 19 20
*10  9  8  7  6*

The final route is marked in bold.
We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.
----

*Note:*


. `2 <= N <= 50`.
. grid[i][j] is a permutation of [0, ..., N*N - 1].
