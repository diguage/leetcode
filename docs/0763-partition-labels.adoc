= 763. Partition Labels

https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/[LeetCode - Partition Labels]


A string `S` of lowercase letters is given.  We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.


*Example 1:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
*Output:* [9,7,8]
*Explanation:*
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
----


*Note:*
. `S` will have length in range `[1, 500]`.
. `S` will consist of lowercase letters (`'a'` to `'z'`) only.
