= 558. Quad Tree Intersection

{leetcode}/problems/quad-tree-intersection/[LeetCode - Quad Tree Intersection^]

A quadtree is a tree data in which each internal node has exactly four children: `topLeft`, `topRight`, `bottomLeft` and `bottomRight`. Quad trees are often used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions.

We want to store True/False information in our quad tree. The quad tree is used to represent a `N * N` boolean grid. For each node, it will be subdivided into four children nodes *until the values in the region it represents are all the same*. Each node has another two boolean attributes : `isLeaf` and `val`. `isLeaf` is true if and only if the node is a leaf node. The `val` attribute for a leaf node contains the value of the region it represents.

For example, below are two quad trees A and B:

A:
+-------+-------+   T: true
|       |       |   F: false
|   T   |   T   |
|       |       |
+-------+-------+
|       |       |
|   F   |   F   |
|       |       |
+-------+-------+
topLeft: T
topRight: T
bottomLeft: F
bottomRight: F

B:               
+-------+---+---+
|       | F | F |
|   T   +---+---+
|       | T | T |
+-------+---+---+
|       |       |
|   T   |   F   |
|       |       |
+-------+-------+
topLeft: T
topRight:
     topLeft: F
     topRight: F
     bottomLeft: T
     bottomRight: T
bottomLeft: T
bottomRight: F

Your task is to implement a function that will take two quadtrees and return a quadtree that represents the logical OR (or union) of the two trees.

A:                 B:                 C (A or B):
+-------+-------+  +-------+---+---+  +-------+-------+
|       |       |  |       | F | F |  |       |       |
|   T   |   T   |  |   T   +---+---+  |   T   |   T   |
|       |       |  |       | T | T |  |       |       |
+-------+-------+  +-------+---+---+  +-------+-------+
|       |       |  |       |       |  |       |       |
|   F   |   F   |  |   T   |   F   |  |   T   |   F   |
|       |       |  |       |       |  |       |       |
+-------+-------+  +-------+-------+  +-------+-------+
----

*Note:*


. Both `A` and `B` represent grids of size `N * N`.
. `N` is guaranteed to be a power of 2.
. If you want to know more about the quad tree, you can refer to its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree">wiki</a>.
. The logic OR operation is defined as this: "A or B" is true if `A is true`, or if `B is true`, or if `both A and B are true`.
