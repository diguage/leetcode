{leetcode}/problems/number-of-ways-to-buy-pens-and-pencils/[LeetCode - 2240. Number of Ways to Buy Pens and Pencils ^]

You are given an integer `total` indicating the amount of money you have. You are also given two integers `cost1` and `cost2` indicating the price of a pen and pencil respectively. You can spend *part or all* of your money to buy multiple quantities (or none) of each kind of writing utensil.

Return _the *number of distinct ways* you can buy some number of pens and pencils._

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* total = 20, cost1 = 10, cost2 = 5
*Output:* 9
*Explanation:* The price of a pen is 10 and the price of a pencil is 5.
- If you buy 0 pens, you can buy 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 pencils.
- If you buy 1 pen, you can buy 0, 1, or 2 pencils.
- If you buy 2 pens, you cannot buy any pencils.
The total number of ways to buy pens and pencils is 5 + 3 + 1 = 9.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* total = 5, cost1 = 10, cost2 = 10
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* The price of both pens and pencils are 10, which cost more than total, so you cannot buy any writing utensils. Therefore, there is only 1 way: buy 0 pens and 0 pencils.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= total, cost1, cost2 <= 10^6^`
