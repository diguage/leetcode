= 1926. Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze

https://leetcode.com/problems/nearest-exit-from-entrance-in-maze/[LeetCode - 1926. Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze ^]

You are given an `m x n` matrix `maze` (*0-indexed*) with empty cells (represented as `'.'`) and walls (represented as `'+'`). You are also given the `entrance` of the maze, where `entrance = [entrance<sub>row</sub>, entrance<sub>col</sub>]` denotes the row and column of the cell you are initially standing at.

In one step, you can move one cell *up*, *down*, *left*, or *right*. You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the *nearest exit* from the `entrance`. An *exit* is defined as an *empty cell* that is at the *border* of the `maze`. The `entrance` *does not count* as an exit.

Return _the *number of steps* in the shortest path from the _`entrance`_ to the nearest exit, or _`-1`_ if no such path exists_.

*Input:* maze = [["+","+",".","+"],[".",".",".","+"],["+","+","+","."]], entrance = [1,2]
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* There are 3 exits in this maze at [1,0], [0,2], and [2,3].
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,2].
- You can reach [1,0] by moving 2 steps left.
- You can reach [0,2] by moving 1 step up.
It is impossible to reach [2,3] from the entrance.
Thus, the nearest exit is [0,2], which is 1 step away.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/nearesr2-grid.jpg" style="width: 253px; height: 253px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* maze = [["+","+","+"],[".",".","."],["+","+","+"]], entrance = [1,0]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* There is 1 exit in this maze at [1,2].
[1,0] does not count as an exit since it is the entrance cell.
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,0].
- You can reach [1,2] by moving 2 steps right.
Thus, the nearest exit is [1,2], which is 2 steps away.

<strong class="example">Example 3:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/nearest3-grid.jpg" style="width: 173px; height: 93px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* maze = [[".","+"]], entrance = [0,0]
*Output:* -1
*Explanation:* There are no exits in this maze.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `maze.length == m`
* `maze[i].length == n`
* `1 <= m, n <= 100`
* `maze[i][j]` is either `'.'` or `'+'`.
* `entrance.length == 2`
* `0 <= entrance<sub>row</sub> < m`
* `0 <= entrance<sub>col</sub> < n`
* `entrance` will always be an empty cell.
