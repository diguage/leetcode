Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |

| 4  | 3.85  |
