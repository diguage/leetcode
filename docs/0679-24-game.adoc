== 679. 24 Game

https://leetcode.com/problems/24-game/[LeetCode - 24 Game]


You have 4 cards each containing a number from 1 to 9.  You need to judge whether they could operated through `*`, `/`, `+`, `-`, `(`, `)` to get the value of 24.


*Example 1:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [4, 1, 8, 7]
*Output:* True
*Explanation:* (8-4) * (7-1) = 24
----


*Example 2:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [1, 2, 1, 2]
*Output:* False
----


*Note:*

. The division operator `/` represents real division, not integer division.  For example, 4 / (1 - 2/3) = 12.
. Every operation done is between two numbers.  In particular, we cannot use `-` as a unary operator.  For example, with `[1, 1, 1, 1]` as input, the expression `-1 - 1 - 1 - 1` is not allowed.
. You cannot concatenate numbers together.  For example, if the input is `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, we cannot write this as 12 + 12.
