https://leetcode.com/problems/mice-and-cheese/[LeetCode - 2611. Mice and Cheese ^]

There are two mice and `n` different types of cheese, each type of cheese should be eaten by exactly one mouse.

A point of the cheese with index `i` (*0-indexed*) is:


* `reward1[i]` if the first mouse eats it.
* `reward2[i]` if the second mouse eats it.


You are given a positive integer array `reward1`, a positive integer array `reward2`, and a non-negative integer `k`.

Return _*the maximum* points the mice can achieve if the first mouse eats exactly _`k`_ types of cheese._

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* reward1 = [1,1,3,4], reward2 = [4,4,1,1], k = 2
*Output:* 15
*Explanation:* In this example, the first mouse eats the 2^nd^ (0-indexed) and the 3^rd^ types of cheese, and the second mouse eats the 0^th^ and the 1^st^ types of cheese.
The total points are 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 15.
It can be proven that 15 is the maximum total points that the mice can achieve.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* reward1 = [1,1], reward2 = [1,1], k = 2
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* In this example, the first mouse eats the 0^th^ (0-indexed) and 1^st^ types of cheese, and the second mouse does not eat any cheese.
The total points are 1 + 1 = 2.
It can be proven that 2 is the maximum total points that the mice can achieve.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n == reward1.length == reward2.length <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= reward1[i], reward2[i] <= 1000`
* `0 <= k <= n`
