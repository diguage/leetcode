= 410. Split Array Largest Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-largest-sum/[LeetCode - Split Array Largest Sum]

Given an array which consists of non-negative integers and an integer _m_, you can split the array into _m_ non-empty continuous subarrays. Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these _m_ subarrays.


*Note:*


If _n_ is the length of array, assume the following constraints are satisfied:

* 1 ≤ _n_ ≤ 1000
* 1 ≤ _m_ ≤ min(50, _n_)



*Examples: *
[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
Input:
*nums* = [7,2,5,10,8]
*m* = 2

Output:
18

Explanation:
There are four ways to split *nums* into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into *[7,2,5]* and *[10,8]*,
where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
