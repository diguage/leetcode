= 786. K-th Smallest Prime Fraction

https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-smallest-prime-fraction/[LeetCode - K-th Smallest Prime Fraction]

A sorted list `A` contains 1, plus some number of primes.  Then, for every p < q in the list, we consider the fraction p/q.

What is the `K`-th smallest fraction considered?  Return your answer as an array of ints, where `answer[0] = p` and `answer[1] = q`.

*Examples:*
*Input:* A = [1, 2, 3, 5], K = 3
*Output:* [2, 5]
*Explanation:*
The fractions to be considered in sorted order are:
1/5, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3.
The third fraction is 2/5.

*Input:* A = [1, 7], K = 1
*Output:* [1, 7]

*Note:*


* `A` will have length between `2` and `2000`.
* Each `A[i]` will be between `1` and `30000`.
* `K` will be between `1` and `A.length * (A.length - 1) / 2`.
