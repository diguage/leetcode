= 2358. Maximum Number of Groups Entering a Competition

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-groups-entering-a-competition/[LeetCode - 2358. Maximum Number of Groups Entering a Competition ^]

You are given a positive integer array `grades` which represents the grades of students in a university. You would like to enter *all* these students into a competition in *ordered* non-empty groups, such that the ordering meets the following conditions:


* The sum of the grades of students in the `i^th^` group is *less than* the sum of the grades of students in the `(i + 1)^th^` group, for all groups (except the last).
* The total number of students in the `i^th^` group is *less than* the total number of students in the `(i + 1)^th^` group, for all groups (except the last).


Return _the *maximum* number of groups that can be formed_.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* grades = [10,6,12,7,3,5]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* The following is a possible way to form 3 groups of students:
- 1^st^ group has the students with grades = [12]. Sum of grades: 12. Student count: 1
- 2^nd^ group has the students with grades = [6,7]. Sum of grades: 6 + 7 = 13. Student count: 2
- 3^rd^ group has the students with grades = [10,3,5]. Sum of grades: 10 + 3 + 5 = 18. Student count: 3
It can be shown that it is not possible to form more than 3 groups.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* grades = [8,8]
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* We can only form 1 group, since forming 2 groups would lead to an equal number of students in both groups.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= grades.length <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= grades[i] <= 10^5^`
