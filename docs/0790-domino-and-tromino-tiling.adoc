Given N, how many ways are there to tile a 2 x N board? *Return your answer modulo 10^9 + 7*.

(In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.)
