{leetcode}/problems/graph-connectivity-with-threshold/[LeetCode - 1627. Graph Connectivity With Threshold ^]

We have `n` cities labeled from `1` to `n`. Two different cities with labels `x` and `y` are directly connected by a bidirectional road if and only if `x` and `y` share a common divisor *strictly greater* than some `threshold`. More formally, cities with labels `x` and `y` have a road between them if there exists an integer `z` such that all of the following are true:


* `x % z == 0`,
* `y % z == 0`, and
* `z > threshold`.


Given the two integers, `n` and `threshold`, and an array of `queries`, you must determine for each `queries[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]` if cities `a<sub>i</sub>` and `b<sub>i</sub>` are connected directly or indirectly. (i.e. there is some path between them).

Return _an array _`answer`_, where _`answer.length == queries.length`_ and _`answer[i]`_ is _`true`_ if for the _`i^th^`_ query, there is a path between _`a<sub>i</sub>`_ and _`b<sub>i</sub>`_, or _`answer[i]`_ is _`false`_ if there is no path._

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

*Input:* n = 6, threshold = 2, queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]
*Output:* [false,false,true]
*Explanation:* The divisors for each number:
1:   1
2:   1, 2
3:   1, [.underline]#3#
4:   1, 2, [.underline]#4#
5:   1, [.underline]#5#
6:   1, 2, [.underline]#3#, [.underline]#6#
Using the underlined divisors above the threshold, only cities 3 and 6 share a common divisor, so they are the
only ones directly connected. The result of each query:
[1,4]   1 is not connected to 4
[2,5]   2 is not connected to 5
[3,6]   3 is connected to 6 through path 3--6

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/10/tmp.jpg" style="width: 532px; height: 302px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 6, threshold = 0, queries = [[4,5],[3,4],[3,2],[2,6],[1,3]]
*Output:* [true,true,true,true,true]
*Explanation:* The divisors for each number are the same as the previous example. However, since the threshold is 0,
all divisors can be used. Since all numbers share 1 as a divisor, all cities are connected.

<strong class="example">Example 3:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/17/ex3.jpg" style="width: 282px; height: 282px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 5, threshold = 1, queries = [[4,5],[4,5],[3,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
*Output:* [false,false,false,false,false]
*Explanation:* Only cities 2 and 4 share a common divisor 2 which is strictly greater than the threshold 1, so they are the only ones directly connected.
Please notice that there can be multiple queries for the same pair of nodes [x, y], and that the query [x, y] is equivalent to the query [y, x].
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `2 <= n <= 10^4^`
* `0 <= threshold <= n`
* `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5^`
* `queries[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> <= cities`
* `a<sub>i</sub> != b<sub>i</sub>`
