= 2430. Maximum Deletions on a String

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-deletions-on-a-string/[LeetCode - 2430. Maximum Deletions on a String ^]

You are given a string `s` consisting of only lowercase English letters. In one operation, you can:


* Delete *the entire string* `s`, or
* Delete the *first* `i` letters of `s` if the first `i` letters of `s` are *equal* to the following `i` letters in `s`, for any `i` in the range `1 <= i <= s.length / 2`.


For example, if `s = "ababc"`, then in one operation, you could delete the first two letters of `s` to get `"abc"`, since the first two letters of `s` and the following two letters of `s` are both equal to `"ab"`.

Return _the *maximum* number of operations needed to delete all of _`s`.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "abcabcdabc"
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:*
- Delete the first 3 letters ("abc") since the next 3 letters are equal. Now, s = "abcdabc".
- Delete all the letters.
We used 2 operations so return 2. It can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of operations needed.
Note that in the second operation we cannot delete "abc" again because the next occurrence of "abc" does not happen in the next 3 letters.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "aaabaab"
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:*
- Delete the first letter ("a") since the next letter is equal. Now, s = "aabaab".
- Delete the first 3 letters ("aab") since the next 3 letters are equal. Now, s = "aab".
- Delete the first letter ("a") since the next letter is equal. Now, s = "ab".
- Delete all the letters.
We used 4 operations so return 4. It can be proven that 4 is the maximum number of operations needed.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "aaaaa"
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* In each operation, we can delete the first letter of s.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= s.length <= 4000`
* `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
