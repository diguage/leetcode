= 126. Word Ladder II

https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/[LeetCode - Word Ladder II^]

Given two words (_beginWord_ and _endWord_), and a dictionary's word list, find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from _beginWord_ to _endWord_, such that:


* Only one letter can be changed at a time
* Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that _beginWord_ is _not_ a transformed word.


*Note:*


* Return an empty list if there is no such transformation sequence.
* All words have the same length.
* All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
* You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
* You may assume _beginWord_ and _endWord_ are non-empty and are not the same.


*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

*Output:*
[
  ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
  ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
]
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

*Output:* []

*Explanation:* The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible* *transformation.
