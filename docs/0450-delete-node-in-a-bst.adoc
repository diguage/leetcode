= 450. Delete Node in a BST

https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/[LeetCode - Delete Node in a BST]

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

. Search for a node to remove.
. If the node is found, delete the node.



*Note:* Time complexity should be O(height of tree).

*Example:*
[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]

root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
key = 3

    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \   \
2   4   7

Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.

One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.

    5
   / \
  4   6
 /     \
2       7

Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].
