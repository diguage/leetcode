= 2245. Maximum Trailing Zeros in a Cornered Path

{leetcode}/problems/maximum-trailing-zeros-in-a-cornered-path/[LeetCode - 2245. Maximum Trailing Zeros in a Cornered Path ^]

You are given a 2D integer array `grid` of size `m x n`, where each cell contains a positive integer.

A *cornered path* is defined as a set of adjacent cells with *at most* one turn. More specifically, the path should exclusively move either *horizontally* or *vertically* up to the turn (if there is one), without returning to a previously visited cell. After the turn, the path will then move exclusively in the *alternate* direction: move vertically if it moved horizontally, and vice versa, also without returning to a previously visited cell.

The *product* of a path is defined as the product of all the values in the path.

Return _the *maximum* number of *trailing zeros* in the product of a cornered path found in _`grid`.

Note:


* *Horizontal* movement means moving in either the left or right direction.
* *Vertical* movement means moving in either the up or down direction.

*Input:* grid = [[23,17,15,3,20],[8,1,20,27,11],[9,4,6,2,21],[40,9,1,10,6],[22,7,4,5,3]]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* The grid on the left shows a valid cornered path.
It has a product of 15 * 20 * 6 * 1 * 10 = 18000 which has 3 trailing zeros.
It can be shown that this is the maximum trailing zeros in the product of a cornered path.

The grid in the middle is not a cornered path as it has more than one turn.
The grid on the right is not a cornered path as it requires a return to a previously visited cell.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* grid = [[4,3,2],[7,6,1],[8,8,8]]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* The grid is shown in the figure above.
There are no cornered paths in the grid that result in a product with a trailing zero.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= m * n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000`
