= 30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words

https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/[LeetCode - Substring with Concatenation of All Words]

You are given a string, *s*, and a list of words, *words*, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in *s* that is a concatenation of each word in *words* exactly once and without any intervening characters.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:
  s =* "barfoothefoobarman",
*  words = *["foo","bar"]
*Output:* `[0,9]`
*Explanation:* Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:
  s =* "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
*  words = *["word","good","best","word"]
*Output:* `[]`
