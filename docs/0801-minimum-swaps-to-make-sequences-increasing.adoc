= 801. Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-make-sequences-increasing/[LeetCode - Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing]

We have two integer sequences `A` and `B` of the same non-zero length.

We are allowed to swap elements `A[i]` and `B[i]`.  Note that both elements are in the same index position in their respective sequences.

At the end of some number of swaps, `A` and `B` are both strictly increasing.  (A sequence is _strictly increasing_ if and only if `A[0] < A[1] < A[2] < ... < A[A.length - 1]`.)

Given A and B, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing.  It is guaranteed that the given input always makes it possible.

*Example:*
*Input:* A = [1,3,5,4], B = [1,2,3,7]
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:*
Swap A[3] and B[3].  Then the sequences are:
A = [1, 3, 5, 7] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4]
which are both strictly increasing.

*Note:*


* `A, B` are arrays with the same length, and that length will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.
* `A[i], B[i]` are integer values in the range `[0, 2000]`.
