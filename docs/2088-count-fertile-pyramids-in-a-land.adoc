A farmer has a *rectangular grid* of land with `m` rows and `n` columns that can be divided into unit cells. Each cell is either *fertile* (represented by a `1`) or *barren* (represented by a `0`). All cells outside the grid are considered barren.

A *pyramidal plot* of land can be defined as a set of cells with the following criteria:


* The number of cells in the set has to be *greater than *`1` and all cells must be *fertile*.
* The *apex* of a pyramid is the *topmost* cell of the pyramid. The *height* of a pyramid is the number of rows it covers. Let `(r, c)` be the apex of the pyramid, and its height be `h`. Then, the plot comprises of cells `(i, j)` where `r <= i <= r + h - 1` *and* `c - (i - r) <= j <= c + (i - r)`.


An *inverse pyramidal plot* of land can be defined as a set of cells with similar criteria:


* The number of cells in the set has to be *greater than *`1` and all cells must be *fertile*.
* The *apex* of an inverse pyramid is the *bottommost* cell of the inverse pyramid. The *height* of an inverse pyramid is the number of rows it covers. Let `(r, c)` be the apex of the pyramid, and its height be `h`. Then, the plot comprises of cells `(i, j)` where `r - h + 1 <= i <= r` *and* `c - (r - i) <= j <= c + (r - i)`.


Some examples of valid and invalid pyramidal (and inverse pyramidal) plots are shown below. Black cells indicate fertile cells.

Given a *0-indexed* `m x n` binary matrix `grid` representing the farmland, return _the *total number* of pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots that can be found in_ `grid`.

 
*Example 1:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/22/1.JPG" style="width: 575px; height: 109px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* grid = [[0,1,1,0],[1,1,1,1]]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* The 2 possible pyramidal plots are shown in blue and red respectively.
There are no inverse pyramidal plots in this grid. 
Hence total number of pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots is 2 + 0 = 2.
----

*Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/22/2.JPG" style="width: 502px; height: 120px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* grid = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* The pyramidal plot is shown in blue, and the inverse pyramidal plot is shown in red. 
Hence the total number of plots is 1 + 1 = 2.
----

*Example 3:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/22/3.JPG" style="width: 676px; height: 148px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* grid = [[1,1,1,1,0],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[0,1,0,0,1]]
*Output:* 13
*Explanation:* There are 7 pyramidal plots, 3 of which are shown in the 2nd and 3rd figures.
There are 6 inverse pyramidal plots, 2 of which are shown in the last figure.
The total number of plots is 7 + 6 = 13.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 1000`
* `1 <= m * n <= 10^5^`
* `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
