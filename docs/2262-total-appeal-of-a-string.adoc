= 2262. Total Appeal of A String

https://leetcode.com/problems/total-appeal-of-a-string/[LeetCode - 2262. Total Appeal of A String ^]

The *appeal* of a string is the number of *distinct* characters found in the string.


* For example, the appeal of `"abbca"` is `3` because it has `3` distinct characters: `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.


Given a string `s`, return _the *total appeal of all of its *substrings*.*_

A *substring* is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "abbca"
*Output:* 28
*Explanation:* The following are the substrings of "abbca":
- Substrings of length 1: "a", "b", "b", "c", "a" have an appeal of 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1 respectively. The sum is 5.
- Substrings of length 2: "ab", "bb", "bc", "ca" have an appeal of 2, 1, 2, and 2 respectively. The sum is 7.
- Substrings of length 3: "abb", "bbc", "bca" have an appeal of 2, 2, and 3 respectively. The sum is 7.
- Substrings of length 4: "abbc", "bbca" have an appeal of 3 and 3 respectively. The sum is 6.
- Substrings of length 5: "abbca" has an appeal of 3. The sum is 3.
The total sum is 5 + 7 + 7 + 6 + 3 = 28.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "code"
*Output:* 20
*Explanation:* The following are the substrings of "code":
- Substrings of length 1: "c", "o", "d", "e" have an appeal of 1, 1, 1, and 1 respectively. The sum is 4.
- Substrings of length 2: "co", "od", "de" have an appeal of 2, 2, and 2 respectively. The sum is 6.
- Substrings of length 3: "cod", "ode" have an appeal of 3 and 3 respectively. The sum is 6.
- Substrings of length 4: "code" has an appeal of 4. The sum is 4.
The total sum is 4 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 20.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5^`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
