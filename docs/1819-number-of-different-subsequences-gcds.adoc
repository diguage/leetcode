= 1819. Number of Different Subsequences GCDs

{leetcode}/problems/number-of-different-subsequences-gcds/[LeetCode - 1819. Number of Different Subsequences GCDs ^]

You are given an array `nums` that consists of positive integers.

The *GCD* of a sequence of numbers is defined as the greatest integer that divides *all* the numbers in the sequence evenly.


* For example, the GCD of the sequence `[4,6,16]` is `2`.


A *subsequence* of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.


* For example, `[2,5,10]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,1,*[.underline]#2#*,4,1,[.underline]#*5*#,[.underline]#*10*#]`.


Return _the *number* of *different* GCDs among all *non-empty* subsequences of_ `nums`.

----
*Input:* nums = [6,10,3]
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* The figure shows all the non-empty subsequences and their GCDs.
The different GCDs are 6, 10, 3, 2, and 1.

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [5,15,40,5,6]
*Output:* 7
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 2 * 10^5^`
