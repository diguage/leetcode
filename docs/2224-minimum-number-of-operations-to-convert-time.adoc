= 2224. Minimum Number of Operations to Convert Time

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-convert-time/[LeetCode - 2224. Minimum Number of Operations to Convert Time ^]

You are given two strings `current` and `correct` representing two *24-hour times*.

24-hour times are formatted as `"HH:MM"`, where `HH` is between `00` and `23`, and `MM` is between `00` and `59`. The earliest 24-hour time is `00:00`, and the latest is `23:59`.

In one operation you can increase the time `current` by `1`, `5`, `15`, or `60` minutes. You can perform this operation *any* number of times.

Return _the *minimum number of operations* needed to convert _`current`_ to _`correct`.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* current = "02:30", correct = "04:35"
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:
*We can convert current to correct in 3 operations as follows:
- Add 60 minutes to current. current becomes "03:30".
- Add 60 minutes to current. current becomes "04:30".
- Add 5 minutes to current. current becomes "04:35".
It can be proven that it is not possible to convert current to correct in fewer than 3 operations.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* current = "11:00", correct = "11:01"
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* We only have to add one minute to current, so the minimum number of operations needed is 1.

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `current` and `correct` are in the format `"HH:MM"`
* `current <= correct`
