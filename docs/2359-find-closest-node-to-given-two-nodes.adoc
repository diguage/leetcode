= 2359. Find Closest Node to Given Two Nodes

{leetcode}/problems/find-closest-node-to-given-two-nodes/[LeetCode - 2359. Find Closest Node to Given Two Nodes ^]

You are given a *directed* graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has *at most one* outgoing edge.

The graph is represented with a given *0-indexed* array `edges` of size `n`, indicating that there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`. If there is no outgoing edge from `i`, then `edges[i] == -1`.

You are also given two integers `node1` and `node2`.

Return _the *index* of the node that can be reached from both _`node1`_ and _`node2`_, such that the *maximum* between the distance from _`node1`_ to that node, and from _`node2`_ to that node is *minimized*_. If there are multiple answers, return the node with the *smallest* index, and if no possible answer exists, return `-1`.

Note that `edges` may contain cycles.

*Input:* edges = [2,2,3,-1], node1 = 0, node2 = 1
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* The distance from node 0 to node 2 is 1, and the distance from node 1 to node 2 is 1.
The maximum of those two distances is 1. It can be proven that we cannot get a node with a smaller maximum distance than 1, so we return node 2.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/07/graph4drawio-4.png" style="width: 195px; height: 161px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]

*Input:* edges = [1,2,-1], node1 = 0, node2 = 2
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* The distance from node 0 to node 2 is 2, and the distance from node 2 to itself is 0.
The maximum of those two distances is 2. It can be proven that we cannot get a node with a smaller maximum distance than 2, so we return node 2.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == edges.length`
* `2 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `-1 <= edges[i] < n`
* `edges[i] != i`
* `0 <= node1, node2 < n`
