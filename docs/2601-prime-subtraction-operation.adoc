https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-subtraction-operation/[LeetCode - 2601. Prime Subtraction Operation ^]

You are given a *0-indexed* integer array `nums` of length `n`.

You can perform the following operation as many times as you want:


* Pick an index `i` that you haven&rsquo;t picked before, and pick a prime `p` *strictly less than* `nums[i]`, then subtract `p` from `nums[i]`.


Return _true if you can make `nums` a strictly increasing array using the above operation and false otherwise._

A *strictly increasing array* is an array whose each element is strictly greater than its preceding element.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [4,9,6,10]
*Output:* true
*Explanation:* In the first operation: Pick i = 0 and p = 3, and then subtract 3 from nums[0], so that nums becomes [1,9,6,10].
In the second operation: i = 1, p = 7, subtract 7 from nums[1], so nums becomes equal to [1,2,6,10].
After the second operation, nums is sorted in strictly increasing order, so the answer is true.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [6,8,11,12]
*Output:* true
*Explanation: *Initially nums is sorted in strictly increasing order, so we don't need to make any operations.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [5,8,3]
*Output:* false
*Explanation:* It can be proven that there is no way to perform operations to make nums sorted in strictly increasing order, so the answer is false.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
* `<font face="monospace">nums.length == n`
