= 1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores

{leetcode}/problems/minimum-difference-between-highest-and-lowest-of-k-scores/[LeetCode - 1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores ^]

You are given a *0-indexed* integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the score of the `i^th^` student. You are also given an integer `k`.

Pick the scores of any `k` students from the array so that the *difference* between the *highest* and the *lowest* of the `k` scores is *minimized*.

Return _the *minimum* possible difference_.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [90], k = 1
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* There is one way to pick score(s) of one student:
- [*[.underline]#90#*]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 90 - 90 = 0.
The minimum possible difference is 0.

----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:
- [*[.underline]#9#*,*[.underline]#4#*,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.
- [*[.underline]#9#*,4,*[.underline]#1#*,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.
- [*[.underline]#9#*,4,1,*[.underline]#7#*]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.
- [9,*[.underline]#4#*,*[.underline]#1#*,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.
- [9,*[.underline]#4#*,1,*[.underline]#7#*]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.
- [9,4,*[.underline]#1#*,*[.underline]#7#*]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.
The minimum possible difference is 2.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5^`
