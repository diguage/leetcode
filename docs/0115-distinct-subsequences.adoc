= 115. Distinct Subsequences

https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/[LeetCode - Distinct Subsequences]

Given a string *S* and a string *T*, count the number of distinct subsequences of *S* which equals *T*.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"` while `"AEC"` is not).

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* S = `"rabbbit"`, T = `"rabbit"`
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:*
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

`rabbbit`
^^^^ ^^
`rabbbit`
^^ ^^^^
`rabbbit`
^^^ ^^^
