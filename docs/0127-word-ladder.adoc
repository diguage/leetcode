通过 https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/solution/[Word Ladder - LeetCode] 讲解，竟然可以抽象成无向无权图，然后通过 `Queue` 将其串联起来，实在好精巧。

Given two words (_beginWord_ and _endWord_), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from _beginWord_ to _endWord_, such that:


* Only one letter can be changed at a time.
* Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that _beginWord_ is _not_ a transformed word.


*Note:*


* Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
* All words have the same length.
* All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
* You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
* You may assume _beginWord_ and _endWord_ are non-empty and are not the same.


*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

*Output:* 5

*Explanation:* As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

*Output:* 0

*Explanation:* The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible* *transformation.
