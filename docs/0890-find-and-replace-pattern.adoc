= 890. Find and Replace Pattern

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-and-replace-pattern/[LeetCode - Find and Replace Pattern]

You have a list of `words` and a `pattern`, and you want to know which words in `words` matches the pattern.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters `p` so that after replacing every letter `x` in the pattern with `p(x)`, we get the desired word.

(_Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter._)

Return a list of the words in `words` that match the given pattern. 

You may return the answer in any order.

 


*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
*Output:* ["mee","aqq"]
*Explanation:* "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}.
"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation,
since a and b map to the same letter.
----

 

*Note:*


* `1 <= words.length <= 50`
* `1 <= pattern.length = words[i].length <= 20`
