= 561. Array Partition I

https://leetcode.com/problems/array-partition-i/[LeetCode - Array Partition I^]


Given an array of *2n* integers, your task is to group these integers into *n* pairs of integer, say (a~1~, b~1~), (a~2~, b~2~), ..., (a~n~, b~n~) which makes sum of min(a~i~, b~i~) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.


*Example 1:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [1,4,3,2]

*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
----


*Note:*

. *n* is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
. All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].
