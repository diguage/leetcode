= 2486. Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/append-characters-to-string-to-make-subsequence/[LeetCode - 2486. Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence ^]

You are given two strings `s` and `t` consisting of only lowercase English letters.

Return _the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of _`s`_ so that _`t`_ becomes a *subsequence* of _`s`.

A *subsequence* is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "coaching", t = "coding"
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* Append the characters "ding" to the end of s so that s = "coachingding".
Now, t is a subsequence of s ("[.underline]#*co*#aching[.underline]#*ding*#").
It can be shown that appending any 3 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "abcde", t = "a"
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* t is already a subsequence of s ("[.underline]#*a*#bcde").
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "z", t = "abcde"
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* Append the characters "abcde" to the end of s so that s = "zabcde".
Now, t is a subsequence of s ("z[.underline]#*abcde*#").
It can be shown that appending any 4 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5^`
* `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.
