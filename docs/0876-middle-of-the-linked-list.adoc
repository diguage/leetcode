= 876. Middle of the Linked List

https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/[LeetCode - Middle of the Linked List]

Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node `head`, return a middle node of linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

 


*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [1,2,3,4,5]
*Output:* Node 3 from this list (Serialization: [3,4,5])
The returned node has value 3.  (The judge's serialization of this node is [3,4,5]).
Note that we returned a ListNode object ans, such that:
ans.val = 3, ans.next.val = 4, ans.next.next.val = 5, and ans.next.next.next = NULL.
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [1,2,3,4,5,6]
*Output:* Node 4 from this list (Serialization: [4,5,6])
Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
----

 

*Note:*


* The number of nodes in the given list will be between `1` and `100`.
