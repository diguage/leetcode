= 1275. Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-winner-on-a-tic-tac-toe-game/[LeetCode - Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game]

Tic-tac-toe is played by two players _A_ and _B_ on a _3_ x _3_ grid.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:


* Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (" ").
* The first player _A_ always places "X" characters, while the second player _B_ always places "O" characters.
* "X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
* The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
* The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
* No more moves can be played if the game is over.


Given an array `moves` where each element is another array of size 2 corresponding to the row and column of the grid where they mark their respective character in the order in which _A_ and _B_ play.

Return the winner of the game if it exists (_A_ or _B_), in case the game ends in a draw return "Draw", if there are still movements to play return "Pending".

You can assume that `moves` is *valid* (It follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty and _A_ will play *first*.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]
*Output:* "A"
*Explanation:* "A" wins, he always plays first.
"X  "    "X  "    "X  "    "X  "    "*X*  "
"   " -> "   " -> " X " -> " X " -> " *X* "
"   "    "O  "    "O  "    "OO "    "OO*X*"
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]
*Output:* "B"
*Explanation:* "B" wins.
"X  "    "X  "    "XX "    "XXO"    "XXO"    "XX*O*"
"   " -> " O " -> " O " -> " O " -> "XO " -> "X*O* " 
"   "    "   "    "   "    "   "    "   "    "*O*  "
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]
*Output:* "Draw"
*Explanation:* The game ends in a draw since there are no moves to make.
"XXO"
"OOX"
"XOX"
----

*Example 4:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* moves = [[0,0],[1,1]]
*Output:* "Pending"
*Explanation:* The game has not finished yet.
"X  "
" O "
"   "
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= moves.length <= 9`
* `moves[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= moves[i][j] <= 2`
* There are no repeated elements on `moves`.
* `moves` follow the rules of tic tac toe.
