= 2347. Best Poker Hand

https://leetcode.com/problems/best-poker-hand/[LeetCode - 2347. Best Poker Hand ^]

You are given an integer array `ranks` and a character array `suits`. You have `5` cards where the `i^th^` card has a rank of `ranks[i]` and a suit of `suits[i]`.

The following are the types of *poker hands* you can make from best to worst:


* `"Flush"`: Five cards of the same suit.
* `"Three of a Kind"`: Three cards of the same rank.
* `"Pair"`: Two cards of the same rank.
* `"High Card"`: Any single card.


Return _a string representing the *best* type of *poker hand* you can make with the given cards._

*Note* that the return values are *case-sensitive*.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* ranks = [13,2,3,1,9], suits = ["a","a","a","a","a"]
*Output:* "Flush"
*Explanation:* The hand with all the cards consists of 5 cards with the same suit, so we have a "Flush".

----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* ranks = [4,4,2,4,4], suits = ["d","a","a","b","c"]
*Output:* "Three of a Kind"
*Explanation:* The hand with the first, second, and fourth card consists of 3 cards with the same rank, so we have a "Three of a Kind".
Note that we could also make a "Pair" hand but "Three of a Kind" is a better hand.
Also note that other cards could be used to make the "Three of a Kind" hand.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* ranks = [10,10,2,12,9], suits = ["a","b","c","a","d"]
*Output:* "Pair"
*Explanation:* The hand with the first and second card consists of 2 cards with the same rank, so we have a "Pair".
Note that we cannot make a "Flush" or a "Three of a Kind".

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `ranks.length == suits.length == 5`
* `1 <= ranks[i] <= 13`
* `'a' <= suits[i] <= 'd'`
* No two cards have the same rank and suit.
