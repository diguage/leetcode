= 1036. Escape a Large Maze

https://leetcode.com/problems/escape-a-large-maze/[LeetCode - Escape a Large Maze]

In a 1 million by 1 million grid, the coordinates of each grid square are `(x, y)` with `0 <= x, y < 10^6`.

We start at the `source` square and want to reach the `target` square.  Each move, we can walk to a 4-directionally adjacent square in the grid that isn't in the given list of `blocked` squares.

Return `true` if and only if it is possible to reach the target square through a sequence of moves.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* blocked = [[0,1],[1,0]], source = [0,0], target = [0,2]
*Output:* false
*Explanation:*
The target square is inaccessible starting from the source square, because we can't walk outside the grid.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* blocked = [], source = [0,0], target = [999999,999999]
*Output:* true
*Explanation:*
Because there are no blocked cells, it's possible to reach the target square.
----

 

*Note:*


. `0 <= blocked.length <= 200`
. `blocked[i].length == 2`
. `0 <= blocked[i][j] < 10^6`
. `source.length == target.length == 2`
. `0 <= source[i][j], target[i][j] < 10^6`
. `source != target`
