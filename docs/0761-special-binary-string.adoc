_Special_ binary strings are binary strings with the following two properties:

. The number of 0's is equal to the number of 1's.
. Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many 1's as 0's.

Given a special string `S`, a _move_ consists of choosing two consecutive, non-empty, special substrings of `S`, and swapping them.  _(Two strings are consecutive if the last character of the first string is exactly one index before the first character of the second string.)_

At the end of any number of moves, what is the lexicographically largest resulting string possible?


*Example 1:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* S = "11011000"
*Output:* "11100100"
*Explanation:*
The strings "10" [occuring at S[1]] and "1100" [at S[3]] are swapped.
This is the lexicographically largest string possible after some number of swaps.
----


*Note:*
. `S` has length at most `50`.
. `S` is guaranteed to be a _special_ binary string as defined above.
