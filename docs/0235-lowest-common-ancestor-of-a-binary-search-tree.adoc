= 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/[LeetCode - Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree]

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor[definition of LCA on Wikipedia]: &ldquo;The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow *a node to be a descendant of itself*).&rdquo;

Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
*Output:* 6
*Explanation:* The LCA of nodes `2` and `8` is `6`.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* The LCA of nodes `2` and `4` is `2`, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
----

 

*Note:*


* All of the nodes' values will be unique.
* p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.
