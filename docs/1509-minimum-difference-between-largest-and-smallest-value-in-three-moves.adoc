= 1509. Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves

{leetcode}/problems/minimum-difference-between-largest-and-smallest-value-in-three-moves/[LeetCode - 1509. Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves ^]

You are given an integer array `nums`.

In one move, you can choose one element of `nums` and change it to *any value*.

Return _the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of `nums` *after performing at most three moves*_.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [5,3,2,4]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* We can make at most 3 moves.
In the first move, change 2 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,4].
In the second move, change 4 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,3].
In the third move, change 5 to 3. nums becomes [3,3,3,3].
After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 3 - 3 = 0.

----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [1,5,0,10,14]
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* We can make at most 3 moves.
In the first move, change 5 to 0. nums becomes [1,0,0,10,14].
In the second move, change 10 to 0. nums becomes [1,0,0,0,14].
In the third move, change 14 to 1. nums becomes [1,0,0,0,1].
After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 1 - 0 = 1.
It can be shown that there is no way to make the difference 0 in 3 moves.
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [3,100,20]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* We can make at most 3 moves.
In the first move, change 100 to 7. nums becomes [3,7,20].
In the second move, change 20 to 7. nums becomes [3,7,7].
In the third move, change 3 to 7. nums becomes [7,7,7].
After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 7 - 7 = 0.

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5^`
* `-10^9^ <= nums[i] <= 10^9^`
