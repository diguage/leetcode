= 959. Regions Cut By Slashes

{leetcode}/problems/regions-cut-by-slashes/[LeetCode - Regions Cut By Slashes^]

In a N x N `grid` composed of 1 x 1 squares, each 1 x 1 square consists of a `/`, `\`, or blank space.  These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.

(Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a `\` is represented as `"\\"`.)

Return the number of regions.
