= 1673. Find the Most Competitive Subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-most-competitive-subsequence/[LeetCode - 1673. Find the Most Competitive Subsequence ^]

Given an integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`, return _the most* competitive* subsequence of _`nums` _of size _`k`.

An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.

We define that a subsequence `a` is more *competitive* than a subsequence `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, subsequence `a` has a number *less* than the corresponding number in `b`. For example, `[1,3,4]` is more competitive than `[1,3,5]` because the first position they differ is at the final number, and `4` is less than `5`.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [3,5,2,6], k = 2
*Output:* [2,6]
*Explanation:* Among the set of every possible subsequence: {[3,5], [3,2], [3,6], [5,2], [5,6], [2,6]}, [2,6] is the most competitive.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [2,4,3,3,5,4,9,6], k = 4
*Output:* [2,3,3,4]
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5^`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9^`
* `1 <= k <= nums.length`
