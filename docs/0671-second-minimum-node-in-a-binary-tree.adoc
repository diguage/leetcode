= 671. Second Minimum Node In a Binary Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/second-minimum-node-in-a-binary-tree/[LeetCode - Second Minimum Node In a Binary Tree^]

Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly `two` or `zero` sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes. More formally, the property `root.val = min(root.left.val, root.right.val)` always holds.

Given such a binary tree, you need to output the *second minimum* value in the set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.

If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* 
    2
   / \
  2   5
     / \
    5   7

*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* 
    2
   / \
  2   2

*Output:* -1
*Explanation:* The smallest value is 2, but there isn't any second smallest value.
