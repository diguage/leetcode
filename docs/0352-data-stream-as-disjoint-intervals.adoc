= 352. Data Stream as Disjoint Intervals

https://leetcode.com/problems/data-stream-as-disjoint-intervals/[LeetCode - Data Stream as Disjoint Intervals]

Given a data stream input of non-negative integers a~1~, a~2~, ..., a~n~, ..., summarize the numbers seen so far as a list of disjoint intervals.

For example, suppose the integers from the data stream are 1, 3, 7, 2, 6, ..., then the summary will be:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
[1, 1]
[1, 1], [3, 3]
[1, 1], [3, 3], [7, 7]
[1, 3], [7, 7]
[1, 3], [6, 7]
----

 

*Follow up:*

What if there are lots of merges and the number of disjoint intervals are small compared to the data stream's size?
