https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-phone-numbers/[LeetCode - Valid Phone Numbers^]

Given a text file `file.txt` that contains list of phone numbers (one per line), write a one liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.

You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx. (x means a digit)

You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or trailing white spaces.

*Example:*

Assume that `file.txt` has the following content:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
987-123-4567
123 456 7890
(123) 456-7890
----

Your script should output the following valid phone numbers:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
987-123-4567
(123) 456-7890
----
