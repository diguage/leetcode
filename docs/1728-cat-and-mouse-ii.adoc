https://leetcode.com/problems/cat-and-mouse-ii/[LeetCode - 1728. Cat and Mouse II ^]

A game is played by a cat and a mouse named Cat and Mouse.

The environment is represented by a `grid` of size `rows x cols`, where each element is a wall, floor, player (Cat, Mouse), or food.


* Players are represented by the characters `'C'`(Cat)`,'M'`(Mouse).
* Floors are represented by the character `'.'` and can be walked on.
* Walls are represented by the character `'#'` and cannot be walked on.
* Food is represented by the character `'F'` and can be walked on.
* There is only one of each character `'C'`, `'M'`, and `'F'` in `grid`.


Mouse and Cat play according to the following rules:


* Mouse *moves first*, then they take turns to move.
* During each turn, Cat and Mouse can jump in one of the four directions (left, right, up, down). They cannot jump over the wall nor outside of the `grid`.
* `catJump, mouseJump` are the maximum lengths Cat and Mouse can jump at a time, respectively. Cat and Mouse can jump less than the maximum length.
* Staying in the same position is allowed.
* Mouse can jump over Cat.


The game can end in 4 ways:


* If Cat occupies the same position as Mouse, Cat wins.
* If Cat reaches the food first, Cat wins.
* If Mouse reaches the food first, Mouse wins.
* If Mouse cannot get to the food within 1000 turns, Cat wins.


Given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid` and two integers `catJump` and `mouseJump`, return `true`_ if Mouse can win the game if both Cat and Mouse play optimally, otherwise return _`false`.

----
*Input:* grid = ["####F","#C...","M...."], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 2
*Output:* true
*Explanation:* Cat cannot catch Mouse on its turn nor can it get the food before Mouse.

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* grid = ["M.C...F"], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 3
*Output:* false
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `rows == grid.length`
* `cols = grid[i].length`
* `1 <= rows, cols <= 8`
* `grid[i][j]` consist only of characters `'C'`, `'M'`, `'F'`, `'.'`, and `'#'`.
* There is only one of each character `'C'`, `'M'`, and `'F'` in `grid`.
* `1 <= catJump, mouseJump <= 8`
