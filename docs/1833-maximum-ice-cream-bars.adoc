It is a sweltering summer day, and a boy wants to buy some ice cream bars.

At the store, there are `n` ice cream bars. You are given an array `costs` of length `n`, where `costs[i]` is the price of the `i^th^` ice cream bar in coins. The boy initially has `coins` coins to spend, and he wants to buy as many ice cream bars as possible. 

*Note:* The boy can buy the ice cream bars in any order.

Return _the *maximum* number of ice cream bars the boy can buy with _`coins`_ coins._

You must solve the problem by counting sort.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* costs = [1,3,2,4,1], coins = 7
*Output:* 4
*Explanation: *The boy can buy ice cream bars at indices 0,1,2,4 for a total price of 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 7.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* costs = [10,6,8,7,7,8], coins = 5
*Output:* 0
*Explanation: *The boy cannot afford any of the ice cream bars.
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* costs = [1,6,3,1,2,5], coins = 20
*Output:* 6
*Explanation: *The boy can buy all the ice cream bars for a total price of 1 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 18.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `costs.length == n`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= costs[i] <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= coins <= 10^8^`
