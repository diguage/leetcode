= 2491. Divide Players Into Teams of Equal Skill

https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-players-into-teams-of-equal-skill/[LeetCode - 2491. Divide Players Into Teams of Equal Skill ^]

You are given a positive integer array `skill` of *even* length `n` where `skill[i]` denotes the skill of the `i^th^` player. Divide the players into `n / 2` teams of size `2` such that the total skill of each team is *equal*.

The *chemistry* of a team is equal to the *product* of the skills of the players on that team.

Return _the sum of the *chemistry* of all the teams, or return _`-1`_ if there is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of each team is equal._

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* skill = [3,2,5,1,3,4]
*Output:* 22
*Explanation:* 
Divide the players into the following teams: (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), where each team has a total skill of 6.
The sum of the chemistry of all the teams is: 1 * 5 + 2 * 4 + 3 * 3 = 5 + 8 + 9 = 22.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* skill = [3,4]
*Output:* 12
*Explanation:* 
The two players form a team with a total skill of 7.
The chemistry of the team is 3 * 4 = 12.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* skill = [1,1,2,3]
*Output:* -1
*Explanation:* 
There is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of each team is equal.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `2 <= skill.length <= 10^5^`
* `skill.length` is even.
* `1 <= skill[i] <= 1000`
