= 3161. Block Placement Queries

https://leetcode.com/problems/block-placement-queries/[LeetCode - 3161. Block Placement Queries ^]

There exists an infinite number line, with its origin at 0 and extending towards the *positive* x-axis.

You are given a 2D array `queries`, which contains two types of queries:


* For a query of type 1, `queries[i] = [1, x]`. Build an obstacle at distance `x` from the origin. It is guaranteed that there is *no* obstacle at distance `x` when the query is asked.
* For a query of type 2, `queries[i] = [2, x, sz]`. Check if it is possible to place a block of size `sz` _anywhere_ in the range `[0, x]` on the line, such that the block *entirely* lies in the range `[0, x]`. A block *cannot *be placed if it intersects with any obstacle, but it may touch it. Note that you do* not* actually place the block. Queries are separate.


Return a boolean array `results`, where `results[i]` is `true` if you can place the block specified in the `i^th^` query of type 2, and `false` otherwise.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">queries = [[1,2],[2,3,3],[2,3,1],[2,2,2]]

*Output:* <span class="example-io">[false,true,true]

*Explanation:*

*<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/04/22/example0block.png" style="padding: 10px; background: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-radius: 0.5rem; width: 309px; height: 129px;" />*

For query 0, place an obstacle at `x = 2`. A block of size at most 2 can be placed before `x = 3`.


<strong class="example">Example 2:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">queries = [[1,7],[2,7,6],[1,2],[2,7,5],[2,7,6]]<!-- notionvc: 4a471445-5af1-4d72-b11b-94d351a2c8e9 -->

*Output:* [true,true,false]

*Explanation:*

*<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/04/22/example1block.png" style="padding: 10px; background: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-radius: 0.5rem; width: 310px; height: 130px;" />*


* Place an obstacle at `x = 7` for query 0. A block of size at most 7 can be placed before `x = 7`.
* Place an obstacle at `x = 2` for query 2. Now, a block of size at most 5 can be placed before `x = 7`, and a block of size at most 2 before `x = 2`.



 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= queries.length <= 15 * 10^4^`
* `2 <= queries[i].length <= 3`
* `1 <= queries[i][0] <= 2`
* `1 <= x, sz <= min(5 * 10^4^, 3 * queries.length)`
* The input is generated such that for queries of type 1, no obstacle exists at distance `x` when the query is asked.
* The input is generated such that there is at least one query of type 2.
