https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-collisions/[LeetCode - 2751. Robot Collisions ^]

There are `n` *1-indexed* robots, each having a position on a line, health, and movement direction.

You are given *0-indexed* integer arrays `positions`, `healths`, and a string `directions` (`directions[i]` is either *'L'* for *left* or *'R'* for *right*). All integers in `positions` are *unique*.

All robots start moving on the line* simultaneously* at the *same speed *in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will *collide*.

If two robots collide, the robot with *lower health* is *removed* from the line, and the health of the other robot *decreases* *by one*. The surviving robot continues in the *same* direction it was going. If both robots have the *same* health, they are both* *removed from the line.

Your task is to determine the *health* of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same *order *that the robots were given,* *i.e. final heath of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array.

Return _an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input), after no further collisions can occur._

*Note:* The positions may be unsorted.

<strong class="example">Example 1:*

*Input:* positions = [5,4,3,2,1], healths = [2,17,9,15,10], directions = "RRRRR"
*Output:* [2,17,9,15,10]
*Explanation:* No collision occurs in this example, since all robots are moving in the same direction. So, the health of the robots in order from the first robot is returned, [2, 17, 9, 15, 10].

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

<img height="176" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/05/15/image-20230516004433-7.png" width="717" />

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* positions = [3,5,2,6], healths = [10,10,15,12], directions = "RLRL"
*Output:* [14]
*Explanation:* There are 2 collisions in this example. Firstly, robot 1 and robot 2 will collide, and since both have the same health, they will be removed from the line. Next, robot 3 and robot 4 will collide and since robot 4's health is smaller, it gets removed, and robot 3's health becomes 15 - 1 = 14. Only robot 3 remains, so we return [14].

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

<img height="172" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/05/15/image-20230516005114-9.png" width="732" />

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* positions = [1,2,5,6], healths = [10,10,11,11], directions = "RLRL"
*Output:* []
*Explanation:* Robot 1 and robot 2 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. Robot 3 and 4 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. So, we return an empty array, [].
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= positions.length == healths.length == directions.length == n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= positions[i], healths[i] <= 10^9^`
* `directions[i] == 'L'` or `directions[i] == 'R'`
* All values in `positions` are distinct
