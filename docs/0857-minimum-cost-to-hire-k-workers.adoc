== 857. Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-hire-k-workers/[LeetCode - Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers]

There are `N` workers.  The `i`-th worker has a `quality[i]` and a minimum wage expectation `wage[i]`.

Now we want to hire exactly `K` workers to form a _paid group_.  When hiring a group of K workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:


. Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.
. Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.


Return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions.

 





*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *quality = <span id="example-input-1-1">[10,20,5], wage = <span id="example-input-1-2">[70,50,30], K = <span id="example-input-1-3">2
*Output: *<span id="example-output-1">105.00000
*Explanation*: We pay 70 to 0-th worker and 35 to 2-th worker.
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *quality = <span id="example-input-2-1">[3,1,10,10,1], wage = <span id="example-input-2-2">[4,8,2,2,7], K = <span id="example-input-2-3">3
*Output: *<span id="example-output-2">30.66667
*Explanation*: We pay 4 to 0-th worker, 13.33333 to 2-th and 3-th workers seperately. 
----

 

*Note:*


. `1 <= K <= N <= 10000`, where `N = quality.length = wage.length`
. `1 <= quality[i] <= 10000`
. `1 <= wage[i] <= 10000`
. Answers within `10^-5` of the correct answer will be considered correct.
