= 447. Number of Boomerangs

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-boomerangs/[LeetCode - Number of Boomerangs]

Given _n_ points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a "boomerang" is a tuple of points `(i, j, k)` such that the distance between `i` and `j` equals the distance between `i` and `k` (*the order of the tuple matters*).

Find the number of boomerangs. You may assume that _n_ will be at most *500* and coordinates of points are all in the range *[-10000, 10000]* (inclusive).

*Example:*
