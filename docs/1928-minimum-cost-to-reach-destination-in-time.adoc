= 1928. Minimum Cost to Reach Destination in Time

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-reach-destination-in-time/[LeetCode - 1928. Minimum Cost to Reach Destination in Time ^]

There is a country of `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1` where *all the cities are connected* by bi-directional roads. The roads are represented as a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, time<sub>i</sub>]` denotes a road between cities `x<sub>i</sub>` and `y<sub>i</sub>` that takes `time<sub>i</sub>` minutes to travel. There may be multiple roads of differing travel times connecting the same two cities, but no road connects a city to itself.

Each time you pass through a city, you must pay a passing fee. This is represented as a *0-indexed* integer array `passingFees` of length `n` where `passingFees[j]` is the amount of dollars you must pay when you pass through city `j`.

In the beginning, you are at city `0` and want to reach city `n - 1` in `maxTime`* minutes or less*. The *cost* of your journey is the *summation of passing fees* for each city that you passed through at some moment of your journey (*including* the source and destination cities).

Given `maxTime`, `edges`, and `passingFees`, return _the *minimum cost* to complete your journey, or _`-1`_ if you cannot complete it within _`maxTime`_ minutes_.

*Input:* maxTime = 30, edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[2,5,10],[0,3,1],[3,4,10],[4,5,15]], passingFees = [5,1,2,20,20,3]
*Output:* 11
*Explanation:* The path to take is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5, which takes 30 minutes and has $11 worth of passing fees.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

*<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/copy-of-leetgraph1-1.png" style="width: 371px; height: 171px;" />*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* maxTime = 29, edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[2,5,10],[0,3,1],[3,4,10],[4,5,15]], passingFees = [5,1,2,20,20,3]
*Output:* 48
*Explanation:* The path to take is 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, which takes 26 minutes and has $48 worth of passing fees.
You cannot take path 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5 since it would take too long.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* maxTime = 25, edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[2,5,10],[0,3,1],[3,4,10],[4,5,15]], passingFees = [5,1,2,20,20,3]
*Output:* -1
*Explanation:* There is no way to reach city 5 from city 0 within 25 minutes.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= maxTime <= 1000`
* `n == passingFees.length`
* `2 <= n <= 1000`
* `n - 1 <= edges.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub> <= n - 1`
* `1 <= time<sub>i</sub> <= 1000`
* `1 <= passingFees[j] <= 1000` 
* The graph may contain multiple edges between two nodes.
* The graph does not contain self loops.
