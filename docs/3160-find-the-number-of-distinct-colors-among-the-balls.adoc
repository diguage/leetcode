= 3160. Find the Number of Distinct Colors Among the Balls

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-number-of-distinct-colors-among-the-balls/[LeetCode - 3160. Find the Number of Distinct Colors Among the Balls ^]

You are given an integer `limit` and a 2D array `queries` of size `n x 2`.

There are `limit + 1` balls with *distinct* labels in the range `[0, limit]`. Initially, all balls are uncolored. For every query in `queries` that is of the form `[x, y]`, you mark ball `x` with the color `y`. After each query, you need to find the number of *distinct* colors among the balls.

Return an array `result` of length `n`, where `result[i]` denotes the number of distinct colors _after_ `i^th^` query.

*Note* that when answering a query, lack of a color _will not_ be considered as a color.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">limit = 4, queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[1,3],[3,4]]

*Output:* <span class="example-io">[1,2,2,3]

* After query 0, ball 1 has color 4.
* After query 1, ball 1 has color 4, and ball 2 has color 5.
* After query 2, ball 1 has color 3, and ball 2 has color 5.
* After query 3, ball 1 has color 3, ball 2 has color 5, and ball 3 has color 4.



<strong class="example">Example 2:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">limit = 4, queries = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,2],[3,4],[4,5]]

*Output:* <span class="example-io">[1,2,2,3,4]

*Explanation:*

*<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/04/17/ezgifcom-crop2.gif" style="width: 457px; height: 144px;" />*


* After query 0, ball 0 has color 1.
* After query 1, ball 0 has color 1, and ball 1 has color 2.
* After query 2, ball 0 has color 1, and balls 1 and 2 have color 2.
* After query 3, ball 0 has color 1, balls 1 and 2 have color 2, and ball 3 has color 4.
* After query 4, ball 0 has color 1, balls 1 and 2 have color 2, ball 3 has color 4, and ball 4 has color 5.



 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= limit <= 10^9^`
* `1 <= n == queries.length <= 10^5^`
* `queries[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= queries[i][0] <= limit`
* `1 <= queries[i][1] <= 10^9^`
