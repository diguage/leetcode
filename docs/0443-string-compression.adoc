= 443. String Compression

https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/[LeetCode - String Compression]

Given an array of characters, compress it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm[*in-place*].

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a *character* (not int) of length 1.

After you are done *modifying the input array https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm[in-place]*, return the new length of the array.
 

*Follow up:*


Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?
 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*
["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

*Output:*
Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

*Explanation:*
"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
----

 

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*
["a"]

*Output:*
Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]

*Explanation:*
Nothing is replaced.
----

 

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*
["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]

*Output:*
Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].

*Explanation:*
Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.
----

 

*Note:*


. All characters have an ASCII value in `[35, 126]`.
. `1 <= len(chars) <= 1000`.
