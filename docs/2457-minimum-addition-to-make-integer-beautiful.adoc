= 2457. Minimum Addition to Make Integer Beautiful

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-addition-to-make-integer-beautiful/[LeetCode - 2457. Minimum Addition to Make Integer Beautiful ^]

You are given two positive integers `n` and `target`.

An integer is considered *beautiful* if the sum of its digits is less than or equal to `target`.

Return the _minimum *non-negative* integer _`x`_ such that _`n + x`_ is beautiful_. The input will be generated such that it is always possible to make `n` beautiful.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 16, target = 6
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* Initially n is 16 and its digit sum is 1 + 6 = 7. After adding 4, n becomes 20 and digit sum becomes 2 + 0 = 2. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 4.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 467, target = 6
*Output:* 33
*Explanation:* Initially n is 467 and its digit sum is 4 + 6 + 7 = 17. After adding 33, n becomes 500 and digit sum becomes 5 + 0 + 0 = 5. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 33.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 1, target = 1
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* Initially n is 1 and its digit sum is 1, which is already smaller than or equal to target.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 10^12^`
* `1 <= target <= 150`
* The input will be generated such that it is always possible to make `n` beautiful.
