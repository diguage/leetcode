= 1932. Merge BSTs to Create Single BST

{leetcode}/problems/merge-bsts-to-create-single-bst/[LeetCode - 1932. Merge BSTs to Create Single BST ^]

You are given `n` *BST (binary search tree) root nodes* for `n` separate BSTs stored in an array `trees` (*0-indexed*). Each BST in `trees` has *at most 3 nodes*, and no two roots have the same value. In one operation, you can:


* Select two *distinct* indices `i` and `j` such that the value stored at one of the *leaves *of `trees[i]` is equal to the *root value* of `trees[j]`.
* Replace the leaf node in `trees[i]` with `trees[j]`.
* Remove `trees[j]` from `trees`.


Return_ the *root* of the resulting BST if it is possible to form a valid BST after performing _`n - 1`_ operations, or__ _`null` _if it is impossible to create a valid BST_.

A BST (binary search tree) is a binary tree where each node satisfies the following property:


* Every node in the node's left subtree has a value *strictly less* than the node's value.
* Every node in the node's right subtree has a value *strictly greater* than the node's value.


A leaf is a node that has no children.

*Input:* trees = [[2,1],[3,2,5],[5,4]]
*Output:* [3,2,5,1,null,4]
*Explanation:*
In the first operation, pick i=1 and j=0, and merge trees[0] into trees[1].
Delete trees[0], so trees = [[3,2,5,1],[5,4]].
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/24/diagram.png" style="width: 450px; height: 181px;" />
In the second operation, pick i=0 and j=1, and merge trees[1] into trees[0].
Delete trees[1], so trees = [[3,2,5,1,null,4]].
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/24/diagram-2.png" style="width: 220px; height: 165px;" />
The resulting tree, shown above, is a valid BST, so return its root.

*Input:* trees = [[5,3,8],[3,2,6]]
*Output:* []
*Explanation:*
Pick i=0 and j=1 and merge trees[1] into trees[0].
Delete trees[1], so trees = [[5,3,8,2,6]].
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/24/diagram-3.png" style="width: 240px; height: 196px;" />
The resulting tree is shown above. This is the only valid operation that can be performed, but the resulting tree is not a valid BST, so return null.

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

*Input:* trees = [[5,4],[3]]
*Output:* []
*Explanation:* It is impossible to perform any operations.

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == trees.length`
* `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4^`
* The number of nodes in each tree is in the range `[1, 3]`.
* Each node in the input may have children but no grandchildren.
* No two roots of `trees` have the same value.
* All the trees in the input are *valid BSTs*.
* `1 <= TreeNode.val <= 5 * 10^4^`.
