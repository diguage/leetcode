= 1968. Array With Elements Not Equal to Average of Neighbors

https://leetcode.com/problems/array-with-elements-not-equal-to-average-of-neighbors/[LeetCode - 1968. Array With Elements Not Equal to Average of Neighbors ^]

You are given a *0-indexed* array `nums` of *distinct* integers. You want to rearrange the elements in the array such that every element in the rearranged array is *not* equal to the *average* of its neighbors.

More formally, the rearranged array should have the property such that for every `i` in the range `1 <= i < nums.length - 1`, `(nums[i-1] + nums[i+1]) / 2` is *not* equal to `nums[i]`.

Return _*any* rearrangement of _`nums`_ that meets the requirements_.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
*Output:* [1,2,4,5,3]
*Explanation:*
When i=1, nums[i] = 2, and the average of its neighbors is (1+4) / 2 = 2.5.
When i=2, nums[i] = 4, and the average of its neighbors is (2+5) / 2 = 3.5.
When i=3, nums[i] = 5, and the average of its neighbors is (4+3) / 2 = 3.5.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [6,2,0,9,7]
*Output:* [9,7,6,2,0]
*Explanation:*
When i=1, nums[i] = 7, and the average of its neighbors is (9+6) / 2 = 7.5.
When i=2, nums[i] = 6, and the average of its neighbors is (7+2) / 2 = 4.5.
When i=3, nums[i] = 2, and the average of its neighbors is (6+0) / 2 = 3.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `3 <= nums.length <= 10^5^`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5^`
