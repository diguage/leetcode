{leetcode}/problems/design-skiplist/[LeetCode - Design Skiplist^]

Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries.

_A Skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to `add`, `erase` and `search`. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists are just simple linked lists._

_For example: we have a Skiplist containing `[30,40,50,60,70,90]` and we want to add `80` and `45` into it. The Skiplist works this way:_

_You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, `add` , `erase` and `search `can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n)._

To be specific, your design should include these functions:


* `bool search(int target)` : Return whether the `target` exists in the Skiplist or not.
* `void add(int num)`: Insert a value into the SkipList. 
* `bool erase(int num)`: Remove a value in the Skiplist. If `num` does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exists multiple `num` values, removing any one of them is fine.

Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.

 

*Example:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
Skiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();

skiplist.add(1);
skiplist.add(2);
skiplist.add(3);
skiplist.search(0);   // return false.
skiplist.add(4);
skiplist.search(1);   // return true.
skiplist.erase(0);    // return false, 0 is not in skiplist.
skiplist.erase(1);    // return true.
skiplist.search(1);   // return false, 1 has already been erased.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `0 <= num, target <= 20000`
* At most `50000` calls will be made to `search`, `add`, and `erase`.
