= 1644. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree II

https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-ii/description/[1644. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree II - LeetCode^]

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes, `p` and `q`. If either node `p` or `q` does not exist in the tree, return `null`. All values of the nodes in the tree are unique.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes `p` and `q` in a binary tree T is the lowest node that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)". A descendant of a node `x` is a node `y` that is on the path from node `x` to some leaf node.


*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
----

*Example 2:*

image::images/1644-02.png[{image_attr}]

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5. A node can be a descendant of itself according to the definition of LCA.
----

*Example 3:*

image::images/1644-03.png[{image_attr}]

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 10
Output: null
Explanation: Node 10 does not exist in the tree, so return null.
----

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-109 <= Node.val <= 109
All Node.val are unique.
p != q
