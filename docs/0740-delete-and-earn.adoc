= 740. Delete and Earn

https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-and-earn/[LeetCode - Delete and Earn]

Given an array `nums` of integers, you can perform operations on the array.

In each operation, you pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. After, you must delete *every* element equal to `nums[i] - 1` or `nums[i] + 1`.

You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* nums = [3, 4, 2]
*Output:* 6
*Explanation:* 
Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.
----

 

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
*Output:* 9
*Explanation:* 
Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.
Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
9 total points are earned.
----

 

*Note:*


* The length of `nums` is at most `20000`.
* Each element `nums[i]` is an integer in the range `[1, 10000]`.
