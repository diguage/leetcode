= Dynamic Programming 动态规划

动态规划的设计思想：「不是直接面对问题求解，而是从一个最小规模的问题开始，新问的最优解均是由比它规模还小的子问题的最优解转换得到，在求解的过程中记录每一步的结果，直至所要求的问题得到解」。

== 树形 DP 套路

树形 DP 套路使用前提：如果题目求解目标是 S 规则，则求解释流程可以定成以每一个节点为头节点的子树在 S 规则下的每一个答案，并且最终答案一定就在其中。

*树形 DP 套路的解题步骤*

. 第一步：以某个节点 X 为头节点的子树中，分析答案有哪些可能性，并且这种分析是以 X 的左子树、X 的右子树和 X 整棵树的角度来考虑可能性的。
+
--
TIP: 请注意这里的顺序：左子树、右子树及整棵树。先左右，如果左右满足，则就可以先上延伸，判断出整棵树。这也是递归调用“触底反弹”的过程。所以，很容易使用递归来完成相关操作。根据上述的流程，使用 *后序遍历* 更合适。
--
+
. 第二步：根据第一步的可能性分析，列出所有需要的信息。比如：最大值、最小值，高度，深度，节点数等等。
. 第三步：合并第二步的信息，对左树和右树提出同样的要求，并写出信息结构。
+
--
TIP: 写出信息结构是把所有的信息都装到一个对象中。如果只需要一个信息，就可以用简单类型来表示了。但是，在树的结构中，大概率是需要多个信息的。
--
+
. 第四步：设计递归函数，递归函数是处理以 X 为头节点的情况下的大难，包括设计递归的 base case，默认直接得到左树和右树的所有信息，以及把可能性做整合，并且要返回第三步的信息结构。
