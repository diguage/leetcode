{leetcode}/problems/minimum-white-tiles-after-covering-with-carpets/[LeetCode - 2209. Minimum White Tiles After Covering With Carpets ^]

You are given a *0-indexed binary* string `floor`, which represents the colors of tiles on a floor:


* `floor[i] = '0'` denotes that the `i^th^` tile of the floor is colored *black*.
* On the other hand, `floor[i] = '1'` denotes that the `i^th^` tile of the floor is colored *white*.


You are also given `numCarpets` and `carpetLen`. You have `numCarpets` *black* carpets, each of length `carpetLen` tiles. Cover the tiles with the given carpets such that the number of *white* tiles still visible is *minimum*. Carpets may overlap one another.

Return _the *minimum* number of white tiles still visible._

*Input:* floor = "10110101", numCarpets = 2, carpetLen = 2
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* 
The figure above shows one way of covering the tiles with the carpets such that only 2 white tiles are visible.
No other way of covering the tiles with the carpets can leave less than 2 white tiles visible.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/10/ex2.png" style="width: 353px; height: 123px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* floor = "11111", numCarpets = 2, carpetLen = 3
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* 
The figure above shows one way of covering the tiles with the carpets such that no white tiles are visible.
Note that the carpets are able to overlap one another.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= carpetLen <= floor.length <= 1000`
* `floor[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
* `1 <= numCarpets <= 1000`
