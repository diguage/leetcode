{leetcode}/problems/additive-number/[LeetCode - Additive Number^]

Additive number is a string whose digits can form additive sequence.

A valid additive sequence should contain *at least* three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Given a string containing only digits `'0'-'9'`, write a function to determine if it's an additive number.

*Note:* Numbers in the additive sequence *cannot* have leading zeros, so sequence `1, 2, 03` or `1, 02, 3` is invalid.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* "112358"
*Output:* true
*Explanation:* The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
             1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* "199100199"
*Output:* true
*Explanation:* The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199. 
             1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199

*Constraints:*


* <font face="monospace">`num` consists only of digits `'0'-'9'`.
* `1 <= num.length <= 35`

How would you handle overflow for very large input integers?
