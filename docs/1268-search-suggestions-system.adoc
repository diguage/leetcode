https://leetcode.com/problems/search-suggestions-system/[LeetCode - Search Suggestions System]

Given an array of strings `products` and a string `searchWord`. We want to design a system that suggests at most three product names from `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with the searchWord. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.

Return _list of lists_ of the suggested `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed. 

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
*Output:* [
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"]
]
*Explanation:* products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"]
After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"]
After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"]
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
*Output:* [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* products = ["bags","baggage","banner","box","cloths"], searchWord = "bags"
*Output:* [["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags"],["bags"]]
----

*Example 4:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* products = ["havana"], searchWord = "tatiana"
*Output:* [[],[],[],[],[],[],[]]
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= products.length <= 1000`
* There are no repeated elements in `products`.
* `1 <= &Sigma; products[i].length <= 2 * 10^4`
* All characters of `products[i]` are lower-case English letters.
* `1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000`
* All characters of `searchWord` are lower-case English letters.
