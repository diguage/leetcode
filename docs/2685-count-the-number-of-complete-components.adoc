= 2685. Count the Number of Complete Components

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-complete-components/[LeetCode - 2685. Count the Number of Complete Components ^]

You are given an integer `n`. There is an *undirected* graph with `n` vertices, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]` denotes that there exists an *undirected* edge connecting vertices `a<sub>i</sub>` and `b<sub>i</sub>`.

Return _the number of *complete connected components* of the graph_.

A *connected component* is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.

A connected component is said to be *complete* if there exists an edge between every pair of its vertices.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

<strong class="example"><img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/04/11/screenshot-from-2023-04-11-23-31-23.png" style="width: 671px; height: 270px;" />*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4]]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* From the picture above, one can see that all of the components of this graph are complete.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

<strong class="example"><img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/04/11/screenshot-from-2023-04-11-23-32-00.png" style="width: 671px; height: 270px;" />*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4],[3,5]]
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* The component containing vertices 0, 1, and 2 is complete since there is an edge between every pair of two vertices. On the other hand, the component containing vertices 3, 4, and 5 is not complete since there is no edge between vertices 4 and 5. Thus, the number of complete components in this graph is 1.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 50`
* `0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> <= n - 1`
* `a<sub>i</sub> != b<sub>i</sub>`
* There are no repeated edges.
