{leetcode}/problems/greatest-sum-divisible-by-three/[LeetCode - Greatest Sum Divisible by Three^]

Given an array `nums` of integers, we need to find the maximum possible sum of elements of the array such that it is divisible by three.




 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* nums = [3,6,5,1,8]
*Output:* 18
*Explanation:* Pick numbers 3, 6, 1 and 8 their sum is 18 (maximum sum divisible by 3).
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* nums = [4]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* Since 4 is not divisible by 3, do not pick any number.

----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* nums = [1,2,3,4,4]
*Output:* 12
*Explanation:* Pick numbers 1, 3, 4 and 4 their sum is 12 (maximum sum divisible by 3).

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= nums.length <= 4 * 10^4`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
