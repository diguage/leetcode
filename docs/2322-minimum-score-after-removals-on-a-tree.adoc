= 2322. Minimum Score After Removals on a Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-score-after-removals-on-a-tree/[LeetCode - 2322. Minimum Score After Removals on a Tree ^]

There is an undirected connected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` edges.

You are given a *0-indexed* integer array `nums` of length `n` where `nums[i]` represents the value of the `i^th^` node. You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where `edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `a<sub>i</sub>` and `b<sub>i</sub>` in the tree.

Remove two *distinct* edges of the tree to form three connected components. For a pair of removed edges, the following steps are defined:


* Get the XOR of all the values of the nodes for *each* of the three components respectively.
* The *difference* between the *largest* XOR value and the *smallest* XOR value is the *score* of the pair.



* For example, say the three components have the node values: `[4,5,7]`, `[1,9]`, and `[3,3,3]`. The three XOR values are `4 ^ 5 ^ 7 = [.underline]#*6*#`, `1 ^ 9 = [.underline]#*8*#`, and `3 ^ 3 ^ 3 = [.underline]#*3*#`. The largest XOR value is `8` and the smallest XOR value is `3`. The score is then `8 - 3 = 5`.


Return _the *minimum* score of any possible pair of edge removals on the given tree_.

*Input:* nums = [1,5,5,4,11], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]]
*Output:* 9
*Explanation:* The diagram above shows a way to make a pair of removals.
- The 1^st^ component has nodes [1,3,4] with values [5,4,11]. Its XOR value is 5 ^ 4 ^ 11 = 10.
- The 2^nd^ component has node [0] with value [1]. Its XOR value is 1 = 1.
- The 3^rd^ component has node [2] with value [5]. Its XOR value is 5 = 5.
The score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 10 - 1 = 9.
It can be shown that no other pair of removals will obtain a smaller score than 9.

*Input:* nums = [5,5,2,4,4,2], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[5,2],[4,3],[1,3]]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* The diagram above shows a way to make a pair of removals.
- The 1^st^ component has nodes [3,4] with values [4,4]. Its XOR value is 4 ^ 4 = 0.
- The 2^nd^ component has nodes [1,0] with values [5,5]. Its XOR value is 5 ^ 5 = 0.
- The 3^rd^ component has nodes [2,5] with values [2,2]. Its XOR value is 2 ^ 2 = 0.
The score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 0 - 0 = 0.
We cannot obtain a smaller score than 0.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == nums.length`
* `3 <= n <= 1000`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^8^`
* `edges.length == n - 1`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> < n`
* `a<sub>i</sub> != b<sub>i</sub>`
* `edges` represents a valid tree.
