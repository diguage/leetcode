= 576. Out of Boundary Paths

https://leetcode.com/problems/out-of-boundary-paths/[LeetCode - Out of Boundary Paths]

There is an *m* by *n* grid with a ball. Given the start coordinate *(i,j)* of the ball, you can move the ball to *adjacent* cell or cross the grid boundary in four directions (up, down, left, right). However, you can *at most* move *N* times. Find out the number of paths to move the ball out of grid boundary. The answer may be very large, return it after mod 10^9^ + 7.

*Note:*


. Once you move the ball out of boundary, you cannot move it back.
. The length and height of the grid is in range [1,50].
. N is in range [0,50].
