= 2285. Maximum Total Importance of Roads

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-total-importance-of-roads/[LeetCode - 2285. Maximum Total Importance of Roads ^]

You are given an integer `n` denoting the number of cities in a country. The cities are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `roads` where `roads[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]` denotes that there exists a *bidirectional* road connecting cities `a<sub>i</sub>` and `b<sub>i</sub>`.

You need to assign each city with an integer value from `1` to `n`, where each value can only be used *once*. The *importance* of a road is then defined as the *sum* of the values of the two cities it connects.

Return _the *maximum total importance* of all roads possible after assigning the values optimally._

*Input:* n = 5, roads = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[0,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
*Output:* 43
*Explanation:* The figure above shows the country and the assigned values of [2,4,5,3,1].
- The road (0,1) has an importance of 2 + 4 = 6.
- The road (1,2) has an importance of 4 + 5 = 9.
- The road (2,3) has an importance of 5 + 3 = 8.
- The road (0,2) has an importance of 2 + 5 = 7.
- The road (1,3) has an importance of 4 + 3 = 7.
- The road (2,4) has an importance of 5 + 1 = 6.
The total importance of all roads is 6 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 6 = 43.
It can be shown that we cannot obtain a greater total importance than 43.

*Input:* n = 5, roads = [[0,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
*Output:* 20
*Explanation:* The figure above shows the country and the assigned values of [4,3,2,5,1].
- The road (0,3) has an importance of 4 + 5 = 9.
- The road (2,4) has an importance of 2 + 1 = 3.
- The road (1,3) has an importance of 3 + 5 = 8.
The total importance of all roads is 9 + 3 + 8 = 20.
It can be shown that we cannot obtain a greater total importance than 20.

*Constraints:*


* `2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4^`
* `1 <= roads.length <= 5 * 10^4^`
* `roads[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> <= n - 1`
* `a<sub>i</sub> != b<sub>i</sub>`
* There are no duplicate roads.
