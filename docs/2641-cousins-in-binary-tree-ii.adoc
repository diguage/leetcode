{leetcode}/problems/cousins-in-binary-tree-ii/[LeetCode - 2641. Cousins in Binary Tree II ^]

Given the `root` of a binary tree, replace the value of each node in the tree with the *sum of all its cousins' values*.

Two nodes of a binary tree are *cousins* if they have the same depth with different parents.

Return _the _`root`_ of the modified tree_.

*Note* that the depth of a node is the number of edges in the path from the root node to it.

*Input:* root = [5,4,9,1,10,null,7]
*Output:* [0,0,0,7,7,null,11]
*Explanation:* The diagram above shows the initial binary tree and the binary tree after changing the value of each node.
- Node with value 5 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 4 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 9 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 1 has a cousin with value 7 so its sum is 7.
- Node with value 10 has a cousin with value 7 so its sum is 7.
- Node with value 7 has cousins with values 1 and 10 so its sum is 11.

*Example 2:*

*Input:* root = [3,1,2]
*Output:* [0,0,0]
*Explanation:* The diagram above shows the initial binary tree and the binary tree after changing the value of each node.
- Node with value 3 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 1 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 2 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^5^]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 10^4^`
