= 451. Sort Characters By Frequency

https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/[LeetCode - Sort Characters By Frequency]

Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

*Example 1:*
[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*
"tree"

*Output:*
"eert"

*Explanation:*
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
----


*Example 2:*
[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*
"cccaaa"

*Output:*
"cccaaa"

*Explanation:*
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
----


*Example 3:*
[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*
"Aabb"

*Output:*
"bbAa"

*Explanation:*
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
