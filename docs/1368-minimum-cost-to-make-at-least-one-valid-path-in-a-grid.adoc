= 1368. Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid

{leetcode}/problems/minimum-cost-to-make-at-least-one-valid-path-in-a-grid/[LeetCode - 1368. Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid ^]

Given an `m x n` grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in this cell. The sign of `grid[i][j]` can be:


* `1` which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i][j + 1]`)
* `2` which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i][j - 1]`)
* `3` which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i + 1][j]`)
* `4` which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i - 1][j]`)


Notice that there could be some signs on the cells of the grid that point outside the grid.

You will initially start at the upper left cell `(0, 0)`. A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell `(0, 0)` and ends at the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)` following the signs on the grid. The valid path does not have to be the shortest.

You can modify the sign on a cell with `cost = 1`. You can modify the sign on a cell *one time only*.

Return _the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path_.

 
*Example 1:*

*Input:* grid = [[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2],[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2]]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* You will start at point (0, 0).
The path to (3, 3) is as follows. (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 3) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (1, 3) --> (1, 2) --> (1, 1) --> (1, 0) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (2, 0) --> (2, 1) --> (2, 2) --> (2, 3) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (3, 3)
The total cost = 3.

*Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/13/grid2.png" style="width: 350px; height: 341px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* grid = [[1,1,3],[3,2,2],[1,1,4]]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* You can follow the path from (0, 0) to (2, 2).

*Example 3:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/13/grid3.png" style="width: 200px; height: 192px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* grid = [[1,2],[4,3]]
*Output:* 1
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 100`
* `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 4`
