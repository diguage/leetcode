= 1319. Number of Operations to Make Network Connected

{leetcode}/problems/number-of-operations-to-make-network-connected/[LeetCode - Number of Operations to Make Network Connected^]

There are `n` computers numbered from `0` to `n-1` connected by ethernet cables `connections` forming a network where `connections[i] = [a, b]` represents a connection between computers `a` and `b`. Any computer can reach any other computer directly or indirectly through the network.

Given an initial computer network `connections`. You can extract certain cables between two directly connected computers, and place them between any pair of disconnected computers to make them directly connected. Return the _minimum number of times_ you need to do this in order to make all the computers connected. If it's not possible, return -1. 

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* Remove cable between computer 1 and 2 and place between computers 1 and 3.

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
*Output:* 2
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2]]
*Output:* -1
*Explanation:* There are not enough cables.
----

*Example 4:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 5, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[3,4],[2,3]]
*Output:* 0
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `1 <= connections.length <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 10^5)`
* `connections[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= connections[i][0], connections[i][1] < n`
* `connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]`
* There are no repeated connections.
* No two computers are connected by more than one cable.
