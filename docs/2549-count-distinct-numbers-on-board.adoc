= 2549. Count Distinct Numbers on Board

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-distinct-numbers-on-board/[LeetCode - 2549. Count Distinct Numbers on Board ^]

You are given a positive integer `n`, that is initially placed on a board. Every day, for `10^9^` days, you perform the following procedure:


* For each number `x` present on the board, find all numbers `1 <= i <= n` such that `x % i == 1`.
* Then, place those numbers on the board.


Return_ the number of *distinct* integers present on the board after_ `10^9^` _days have elapsed_.

*Note:*


* Once a number is placed on the board, it will remain on it until the end.
* `%` stands for the modulo operation. For example, `14 % 3` is `2`.


 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 5
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* Initially, 5 is present on the board. 
The next day, 2 and 4 will be added since 5 % 2 == 1 and 5 % 4 == 1. 
After that day, 3 will be added to the board because 4 % 3 == 1. 
At the end of a billion days, the distinct numbers on the board will be 2, 3, 4, and 5. 
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 3
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* 
Since 3 % 2 == 1, 2 will be added to the board. 
After a billion days, the only two distinct numbers on the board are 2 and 3. 
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 100`
