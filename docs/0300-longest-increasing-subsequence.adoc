= 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/[LeetCode - Longest Increasing Subsequence]

动态规划+二分查找的算法还需要再仔细研究一下。还是有些懵逼！

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

*Example:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* `[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
`*Output:* 4 
*Explanation:* The longest increasing subsequence is `[2,3,7,101]`, therefore the length is `4`.
----

*Note: *


* There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
* Your algorithm should run in O(_n^2^_) complexity.


*Follow up:* Could you improve it to O(_n_ log _n_) time complexity?
