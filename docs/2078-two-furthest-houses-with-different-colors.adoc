= 2078. Two Furthest Houses With Different Colors

{leetcode}/problems/two-furthest-houses-with-different-colors/[LeetCode - 2078. Two Furthest Houses With Different Colors ^]

There are `n` houses evenly lined up on the street, and each house is beautifully painted. You are given a *0-indexed* integer array `colors` of length `n`, where `colors[i]` represents the color of the `i^th^` house.

Return _the *maximum* distance between *two* houses with *different* colors_.

The distance between the `i^th^` and `j^th^` houses is `abs(i - j)`, where `abs(x)` is the *absolute value* of `x`.

*Input:* colors = [[.underline]#*1*#,1,1,*[.underline]#6#*,1,1,1]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* In the above image, color 1 is blue, and color 6 is red.
The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 3.
House 0 has color 1, and house 3 has color 6. The distance between them is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
Note that houses 3 and 6 can also produce the optimal answer.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/31/eg2.png" style="width: 426px; height: 84px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* colors = [[.underline]#*1*#,8,3,8,[.underline]#*3*#]
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* In the above image, color 1 is blue, color 8 is yellow, and color 3 is green.
The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 4.
House 0 has color 1, and house 4 has color 3. The distance between them is abs(0 - 4) = 4.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* colors = [[.underline]#*0*#,*[.underline]#1#*]
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 1.
House 0 has color 0, and house 1 has color 1. The distance between them is abs(0 - 1) = 1.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == colors.length`
* `2 <= n <= 100`
* `0 <= colors[i] <= 100`
* Test data are generated such that *at least* two houses have different colors.
