== 594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-harmonious-subsequence/[LeetCode - Longest Harmonious Subsequence]

We define a harmounious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is *exactly* 1.

Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence">subsequences</a>.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
----

 

*Note:* The length of the input array will not exceed 20,000.
