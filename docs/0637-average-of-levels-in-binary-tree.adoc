https://leetcode.com/problems/average-of-levels-in-binary-tree/[LeetCode - Average of Levels in Binary Tree]

Given a non-empty binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.

*Example 1:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
*Output:* [3, 14.5, 11]
*Explanation:*
The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3,  on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11. Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].
