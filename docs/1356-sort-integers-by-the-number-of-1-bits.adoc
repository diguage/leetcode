= 1356. Sort Integers by The Number of 1 Bits

{leetcode}/problems/sort-integers-by-the-number-of-1-bits/[LeetCode - 1356. Sort Integers by The Number of 1 Bits ^]

You are given an integer array `arr`. Sort the integers in the array in ascending order by the number of `1`'s in their binary representation and in case of two or more integers have the same number of `1`'s you have to sort them in ascending order.

Return _the array after sorting it_.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
*Output:* [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
*Explantion:* [0] is the only integer with 0 bits.
[1,2,4,8] all have 1 bit.
[3,5,6] have 2 bits.
[7] has 3 bits.
The sorted array by bits is [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* arr = [1024,512,256,128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1]
*Output:* [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024]
*Explantion:* All integers have 1 bit in the binary representation, you should just sort them in ascending order.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= arr.length <= 500`
* `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^4^`
