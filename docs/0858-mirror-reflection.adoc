= 858. Mirror Reflection

https://leetcode.com/problems/mirror-reflection/[LeetCode - Mirror Reflection]

There is a special square room with mirrors on each of the four walls.  Except for the southwest corner, there are receptors on each of the remaining corners, numbered `0`, `1`, and `2`.

The square room has walls of length `p`, and a laser ray from the southwest corner first meets the east wall at a distance `q` from the `0`th receptor.

Return the number of the receptor that the ray meets first.  (It is guaranteed that the ray will meet a receptor eventually.)

 


*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* p = 2, q = 1
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* The ray meets receptor 2 the first time it gets reflected back to the left wall.

. `0 <= q <= p`
