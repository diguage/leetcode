= 2171. Removing Minimum Number of Magic Beans

{leetcode}/problems/removing-minimum-number-of-magic-beans/[LeetCode - 2171. Removing Minimum Number of Magic Beans ^]

You are given an array of *positive* integers `beans`, where each integer represents the number of magic beans found in a particular magic bag.

*Remove* any number of beans (*possibly none*) from each bag such that the number of beans in each remaining *non-empty* bag (still containing *at least one* bean) is *equal*. Once a bean has been removed from a bag, you are *not* allowed to return it to any of the bags.

Return _the *minimum* number of magic beans that you have to remove_.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* beans = [4,1,6,5]
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* 
- We remove 1 bean from the bag with only 1 bean.
  This results in the remaining bags: [4,*[.underline]#0#*,6,5]
- Then we remove 2 beans from the bag with 6 beans.
  This results in the remaining bags: [4,0,*[.underline]#4#*,5]
- Then we remove 1 bean from the bag with 5 beans.
  This results in the remaining bags: [4,0,4,*[.underline]#4#*]
We removed a total of 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 beans to make the remaining non-empty bags have an equal number of beans.
There are no other solutions that remove 4 beans or fewer.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* beans = [2,10,3,2]
*Output:* 7
*Explanation:*
- We remove 2 beans from one of the bags with 2 beans.
  This results in the remaining bags: [[.underline]#*0*#,10,3,2]
- Then we remove 2 beans from the other bag with 2 beans.
  This results in the remaining bags: [0,10,3,[.underline]#*0*#]
- Then we remove 3 beans from the bag with 3 beans. 
  This results in the remaining bags: [0,10,[.underline]#*0*#,0]
We removed a total of 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 beans to make the remaining non-empty bags have an equal number of beans.
There are no other solutions that removes 7 beans or fewer.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= beans.length <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= beans[i] <= 10^5^`
