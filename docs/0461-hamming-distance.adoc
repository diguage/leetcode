= 461. Hamming Distance

https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/[LeetCode - Hamming Distance]

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance[Hamming distance] between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.

*Note:*


0 â‰¤ `x`, `y` < 2^31^.


*Example:*
[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* x = 1, y = 4

*Output:* 2

*Explanation:*
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       &uarr;   &uarr;

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
