= 629. K Inverse Pairs Array

{leetcode}/problems/k-inverse-pairs-array/[LeetCode - K Inverse Pairs Array^]

Given two integers `n` and `k`, find how many different arrays consist of numbers from `1` to `n` such that there are exactly `k` inverse pairs.

We define an inverse pair as following: For `i~th~` and `j~th~` element in the array, if `i` < `j` and `a[i]` > `a[j]` then it's an inverse pair; Otherwise, it's not.

Since the answer may be very large, the answer should be modulo 10^9^ + 7.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 3, k = 0
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* 
Only the array [1,2,3] which consists of numbers from 1 to 3 has exactly 0 inverse pair.
----

 

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 3, k = 1
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* 
The array [1,3,2] and [2,1,3] have exactly 1 inverse pair.
----

 

*Note:*


. The integer `n` is in the range [1, 1000] and `k` is in the range [0, 1000].
