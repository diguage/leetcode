= 843. Guess the Word

https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-the-word/[LeetCode - Guess the Word]

This problem is an *_interactive problem_* new to the LeetCode platform.

We are given a word list of unique words, each word is 6 letters long, and one word in this list is chosen as *secret*.

You may call `master.guess(word)` to guess a word.  The guessed word should have type `string` and must be from the original list with 6 lowercase letters.

This function returns an `integer` type, representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the *secret word*.  Also, if your guess is not in the given wordlist, it will return `-1` instead.

For each test case, you have 10 guesses to guess the word. At the end of any number of calls, if you have made 10 or less calls to `master.guess` and at least one of these guesses was the *secret*, you pass the testcase.

Besides the example test case below, there will be 5 additional test cases, each with 100 words in the word list.  The letters of each word in those testcases were chosen independently at random from `'a'` to `'z'`, such that every word in the given word lists is unique.

*Example 1:*
*Input:* secret = "acckzz", wordlist = ["acckzz","ccbazz","eiowzz","abcczz"]

*Explanation:*

`master.guess("aaaaaa")` returns -1, because `"aaaaaa"` is not in wordlist.
`master.guess("acckzz") `returns 6, because `"acckzz"` is secret and has all 6 matches.
`master.guess("ccbazz")` returns 3, because` "ccbazz"` has 3 matches.
`master.guess("eiowzz")` returns 2, because `"eiowzz"` has 2 matches.
`master.guess("abcczz")` returns 4, because `"abcczz"` has 4 matches.

We made 5 calls to master.guess and one of them was the secret, so we pass the test case.
