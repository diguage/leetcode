https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/[LeetCode - Jewels and Stones]

You're given strings `J` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `S` representing the stones you have.  Each character in `S` is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in `J` are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in `J` and `S` are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
*Output:* 3
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* J = "z", S = "ZZ"
*Output:* 0
----

*Note:*


* `S` and `J` will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
* The characters in `J` are distinct.
