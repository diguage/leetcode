= 1263. Minimum Moves to Move a Box to Their Target Location

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-move-a-box-to-their-target-location/[LeetCode - Minimum Moves to Move a Box to Their Target Location]

Storekeeper is a game in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse trying to get them to target locations.

The game is represented by a `grid` of size `m x n`, where each element is a wall, floor, or a box.

Your task is move the box `'B'` to the target position `'T'` under the following rules:


* Player is represented by character `'S'` and can move up, down, left, right in the `grid` if it is a floor (empy cell).
* Floor is represented by character `'.'` that means free cell to walk.
* Wall is represented by character `'#'` that means obstacle  (impossible to walk there). 
* There is only one box `'B'` and one target cell `'T'` in the `grid`.
* The box can be moved to an adjacent free cell by standing next to the box and then moving in the direction of the box. This is a *push*.
* The player cannot walk through the box.


Return the minimum number of *pushes* to move the box to the target. If there is no way to reach the target, return `-1`.

*Input:* grid = [["#","#","#","#","#","#"],
               ["#","T","#","#","#","#"],
               ["#",".",".","B",".","#"],
               ["#",".","#","#",".","#"],
               ["#",".",".",".","S","#"],
               ["#","#","#","#","#","#"]]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* We return only the number of times the box is pushed.

*Constraints:*


* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m <= 20`
* `1 <= n <= 20`
* `grid` contains only characters `'.'`, `'#'`,  `'S'` , `'T'`, or `'B'`.
* There is only one character `'S'`, `'B'` <font face="sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, Trebuchet MS">and `'T'` in the `grid`.
