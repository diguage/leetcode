= 894. All Possible Full Binary Trees

https://leetcode.com/problems/all-possible-full-binary-trees/[LeetCode - All Possible Full Binary Trees]

A _full binary tree_ is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2 children.

Return a list of all possible full binary trees with `N` nodes.  Each element of the answer is the root node of one possible tree.

Each `node` of each tree in the answer *must* have `node.val = 0`.

You may return the final list of trees in any order.
