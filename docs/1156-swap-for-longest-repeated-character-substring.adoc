= 1156. Swap For Longest Repeated Character Substring

{leetcode}/problems/swap-for-longest-repeated-character-substring/[LeetCode - Swap For Longest Repeated Character Substring^]

Given a string `text`, we are allowed to swap two of the characters in the string. Find the length of the longest substring with repeated characters.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* text = "ababa"
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* We can swap the first 'b' with the last 'a', or the last 'b' with the first 'a'. Then, the longest repeated character substring is "aaa", which its length is 3.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* text = "aaabaaa"
*Output:* 6
*Explanation:* Swap 'b' with the last 'a' (or the first 'a'), and we get longest repeated character substring "aaaaaa", which its length is 6.
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* text = "aaabbaaa"
*Output:* 4
----

*Example 4:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* text = "aaaaa"
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* No need to swap, longest repeated character substring is "aaaaa", length is 5.
----

*Example 5:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* text = "abcdef"
*Output:* 1
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= text.length <= 20000`
* `text` consist of lowercase English characters only.
