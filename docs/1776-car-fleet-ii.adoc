{leetcode}/problems/car-fleet-ii/[LeetCode - 1776. Car Fleet II ^]

There are `n` cars traveling at different speeds in the same direction along a one-lane road. You are given an array `cars` of length `n`, where `cars[i] = [position<sub>i</sub>, speed<sub>i</sub>]` represents:


* `position<sub>i</sub>` is the distance between the `i^th^` car and the beginning of the road in meters. It is guaranteed that `position<sub>i</sub> < position<sub>i+1</sub>`.
* `speed<sub>i</sub>` is the initial speed of the `i^th^` car in meters per second.


For simplicity, cars can be considered as points moving along the number line. Two cars collide when they occupy the same position. Once a car collides with another car, they unite and form a single car fleet. The cars in the formed fleet will have the same position and the same speed, which is the initial speed of the *slowest* car in the fleet.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the time, in seconds, at which the `i^th^` car collides with the next car, or `-1` if the car does not collide with the next car. Answers within `10^-5^` of the actual answers are accepted.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* cars = [[1,2],[2,1],[4,3],[7,2]]
*Output:* [1.00000,-1.00000,3.00000,-1.00000]
*Explanation:* After exactly one second, the first car will collide with the second car, and form a car fleet with speed 1 m/s. After exactly 3 seconds, the third car will collide with the fourth car, and form a car fleet with speed 2 m/s.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* cars = [[3,4],[5,4],[6,3],[9,1]]
*Output:* [2.00000,1.00000,1.50000,-1.00000]
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= cars.length <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= position<sub>i</sub>, speed<sub>i</sub> <= 10^6^`
* `position<sub>i</sub> < position<sub>i+1</sub>`
