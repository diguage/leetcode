= 202. Happy Number

https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/[LeetCode - Happy Number]

竟然可以使用"双指针"，类似判断链表中是否有环的思路！妙！


Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

*Example: *

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* 19
*Output:* true
*Explanation: 
*1^2^ + 9^2^ = 82
8^2^ + 2^2^ = 68
6^2^ + 8^2^ = 100
1^2^ + 0^2^ + 0^2^ = 1
