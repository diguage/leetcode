= 365. Water and Jug Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/water-and-jug-problem/[LeetCode - Water and Jug Problem]

You are given two jugs with capacities _x_ and _y_ litres. There is an infinite amount of water supply available. You need to determine whether it is possible to measure exactly _z_ litres using these two jugs.

If _z_ liters of water is measurable, you must have _z_ liters of water contained within *one or both buckets* by the end.

Operations allowed:


* Fill any of the jugs completely with water.
* Empty any of the jugs.
* Pour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely full or the first jug itself is empty.
