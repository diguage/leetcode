= 2150. Find All Lonely Numbers in the Array

{leetcode}/problems/find-all-lonely-numbers-in-the-array/[LeetCode - 2150. Find All Lonely Numbers in the Array ^]

You are given an integer array `nums`. A number `x` is *lonely* when it appears only *once*, and no *adjacent* numbers (i.e. `x + 1` and `x - 1)` appear in the array.

Return _*all* lonely numbers in _`nums`. You may return the answer in *any order*.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [10,6,5,8]
*Output:* [10,8]
*Explanation:* 
- 10 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 9 and 11 does not appear in nums.
- 8 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 7 and 9 does not appear in nums.
- 5 is not a lonely number since 6 appears in nums and vice versa.
Hence, the lonely numbers in nums are [10, 8].
Note that [8, 10] may also be returned.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [1,3,5,3]
*Output:* [1,5]
*Explanation:* 
- 1 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 0 and 2 does not appear in nums.
- 5 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 4 and 6 does not appear in nums.
- 3 is not a lonely number since it appears twice.
Hence, the lonely numbers in nums are [1, 5].
Note that [5, 1] may also be returned.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5^`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^6^`
