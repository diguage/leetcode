= 2812. Find the Safest Path in a Grid

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-safest-path-in-a-grid/[LeetCode - 2812. Find the Safest Path in a Grid ^]

You are given a *0-indexed* 2D matrix `grid` of size `n x n`, where `(r, c)` represents:


* A cell containing a thief if `grid[r][c] = 1`
* An empty cell if `grid[r][c] = 0`


You are initially positioned at cell `(0, 0)`. In one move, you can move to any adjacent cell in the grid, including cells containing thieves.

The *safeness factor* of a path on the grid is defined as the *minimum* manhattan distance from any cell in the path to any thief in the grid.

Return _the *maximum safeness factor* of all paths leading to cell _`(n - 1, n - 1)`_._

An *adjacent* cell of cell `(r, c)`, is one of the cells `(r, c + 1)`, `(r, c - 1)`, `(r + 1, c)` and `(r - 1, c)` if it exists.

The *Manhattan distance* between two cells `(a, b)` and `(x, y)` is equal to `|a - x| + |b - y|`, where `|val|` denotes the absolute value of val.

*Input:* grid = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* All paths from (0, 0) to (n - 1, n - 1) go through the thieves in cells (0, 0) and (n - 1, n - 1).

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* grid = [[0,0,1],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* The path depicted in the picture above has a safeness factor of 2 since:
- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (0, 2) is cell (0, 0). The distance between them is | 0 - 0 | + | 0 - 2 | = 2.
It can be shown that there are no other paths with a higher safeness factor.

<strong class="example">Example 3:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/07/02/example3.png" style="width: 362px; height: 242px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* grid = [[0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* The path depicted in the picture above has a safeness factor of 2 since:
- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (0, 3) is cell (1, 2). The distance between them is | 0 - 1 | + | 3 - 2 | = 2.
- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (3, 0) is cell (3, 2). The distance between them is | 3 - 3 | + | 0 - 2 | = 2.
It can be shown that there are no other paths with a higher safeness factor.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= grid.length == n <= 400`
* `grid[i].length == n`
* `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
* There is at least one thief in the `grid`.
