= 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/[LeetCode - Median of Two Sorted Arrays]

There are two sorted arrays *nums1* and *nums2* of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

You may assume *nums1* and *nums2* cannot be both empty.

.Example 1:
[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
----

.Example 2:
[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
