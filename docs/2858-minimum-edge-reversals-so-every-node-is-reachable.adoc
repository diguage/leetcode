= 2858. Minimum Edge Reversals So Every Node Is Reachable

{leetcode}/problems/minimum-edge-reversals-so-every-node-is-reachable/[LeetCode - 2858. Minimum Edge Reversals So Every Node Is Reachable ^]

There is a *simple directed graph* with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The graph would form a *tree* if its edges were bi-directional.

You are given an integer `n` and a *2D* integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]` represents a *directed edge* going from node `u<sub>i</sub>` to node `v<sub>i</sub>`.

An *edge reversal* changes the direction of an edge, i.e., a directed edge going from node `u<sub>i</sub>` to node `v<sub>i</sub>` becomes a directed edge going from node `v<sub>i</sub>` to node `u<sub>i</sub>`.

For every node `i` in the range `[0, n - 1]`, your task is to *independently* calculate the *minimum* number of *edge reversals* required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node `i` through a *sequence* of *directed edges*.

Return _an integer array _`answer`_, where _`answer[i]`_ is the__ _ _*minimum* number of *edge reversals* required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node _`i`_ through a *sequence* of *directed edges*._

*Input:* n = 4, edges = [[2,0],[2,1],[1,3]]
*Output:* [1,1,0,2]
*Explanation:* The image above shows the graph formed by the edges.
For node 0: after reversing the edge [2,0], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 0.
So, answer[0] = 1.
For node 1: after reversing the edge [2,1], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 1.
So, answer[1] = 1.
For node 2: it is already possible to reach any other node starting from node 2.
So, answer[2] = 0.
For node 3: after reversing the edges [1,3] and [2,1], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 3.
So, answer[3] = 2.

*Input:* n = 3, edges = [[1,2],[2,0]]
*Output:* [2,0,1]
*Explanation:* The image above shows the graph formed by the edges.
For node 0: after reversing the edges [2,0] and [1,2], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 0.
So, answer[0] = 2.
For node 1: it is already possible to reach any other node starting from node 1.
So, answer[1] = 0.
For node 2: after reversing the edge [1, 2], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 2.
So, answer[2] = 1.

*Constraints:*


* `2 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `edges.length == n - 1`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= u<sub>i</sub> == edges[i][0] < n`
* `0 <= v<sub>i</sub> == edges[i][1] < n`
* `u<sub>i</sub> != v<sub>i</sub>`
* The input is generated such that if the edges were bi-directional, the graph would be a tree.
