= 2392. Build a Matrix With Conditions

{leetcode}/problems/build-a-matrix-with-conditions/[LeetCode - 2392. Build a Matrix With Conditions ^]

You are given a *positive* integer `k`. You are also given:


* a 2D integer array `rowConditions` of size `n` where `rowConditions[i] = [above<sub>i</sub>, below<sub>i</sub>]`, and
* a 2D integer array `colConditions` of size `m` where `colConditions[i] = [left<sub>i</sub>, right<sub>i</sub>]`.


The two arrays contain integers from `1` to `k`.

You have to build a `k x k` matrix that contains each of the numbers from `1` to `k` *exactly once*. The remaining cells should have the value `0`.

The matrix should also satisfy the following conditions:


* The number `above<sub>i</sub>` should appear in a *row* that is strictly *above* the row at which the number `below<sub>i</sub>` appears for all `i` from `0` to `n - 1`.
* The number `left<sub>i</sub>` should appear in a *column* that is strictly *left* of the column at which the number `right<sub>i</sub>` appears for all `i` from `0` to `m - 1`.


Return _*any* matrix that satisfies the conditions_. If no answer exists, return an empty matrix.

*Input:* k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[3,2]], colConditions = [[2,1],[3,2]]
*Output:* [[3,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,2,0]]
*Explanation:* The diagram above shows a valid example of a matrix that satisfies all the conditions.
The row conditions are the following:
- Number 1 is in row [.underline]#1#, and number 2 is in row [.underline]#2#, so 1 is above 2 in the matrix.
- Number 3 is in row [.underline]#0#, and number 2 is in row [.underline]#2#, so 3 is above 2 in the matrix.
The column conditions are the following:
- Number 2 is in column [.underline]#1#, and number 1 is in column [.underline]#2#, so 2 is left of 1 in the matrix.
- Number 3 is in column [.underline]#0#, and number 2 is in column [.underline]#1#, so 3 is left of 2 in the matrix.
Note that there may be multiple correct answers.

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1],[2,3]], colConditions = [[2,1]]
*Output:* []
*Explanation:* From the first two conditions, 3 has to be below 1 but the third conditions needs 3 to be above 1 to be satisfied.
No matrix can satisfy all the conditions, so we return the empty matrix.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `2 <= k <= 400`
* `1 <= rowConditions.length, colConditions.length <= 10^4^`
* `rowConditions[i].length == colConditions[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= above<sub>i</sub>, below<sub>i</sub>, left<sub>i</sub>, right<sub>i</sub> <= k`
* `above<sub>i</sub> != below<sub>i</sub>`
* `left<sub>i</sub> != right<sub>i</sub>`
