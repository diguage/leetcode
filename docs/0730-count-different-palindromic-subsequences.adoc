== 730. Count Different Palindromic Subsequences

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-different-palindromic-subsequences/[LeetCode - Count Different Palindromic Subsequences]


Given a string S, find the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences in S, and *return that number modulo `10^9 + 7`.*

A subsequence of a string S is obtained by deleting 0 or more characters from S.

A sequence is palindromic if it is equal to the sequence reversed.

Two sequences `A_1, A_2, ...` and `B_1, B_2, ...` are different if there is some `i` for which `A_i != B_i`.


*Example 1:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* 
S = 'bccb'
*Output:* 6
*Explanation:* 
The 6 different non-empty palindromic subsequences are 'b', 'c', 'bb', 'cc', 'bcb', 'bccb'.
Note that 'bcb' is counted only once, even though it occurs twice.
----


*Example 2:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* 
S = 'abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcddcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcba'
*Output:* 104860361
*Explanation:* 
There are 3104860382 different non-empty palindromic subsequences, which is 104860361 modulo 10^9 + 7.
----


*Note:*
. The length of `S` will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.</li>
. Each character `S[i]` will be in the set `{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}`.</li>
