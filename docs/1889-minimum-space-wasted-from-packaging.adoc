= 1889. Minimum Space Wasted From Packaging

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-space-wasted-from-packaging/[LeetCode - 1889. Minimum Space Wasted From Packaging ^]

You have `n` packages that you are trying to place in boxes, *one package in each box*. There are `m` suppliers that each produce boxes of *different sizes* (with infinite supply). A package can be placed in a box if the size of the package is *less than or equal to* the size of the box.

The package sizes are given as an integer array `packages`, where `packages[i]` is the *size* of the `i^th^` package. The suppliers are given as a 2D integer array `boxes`, where `boxes[j]` is an array of *box sizes* that the `j^th^` supplier produces.

You want to choose a *single supplier* and use boxes from them such that the *total wasted space *is *minimized*. For each package in a box, we define the space *wasted* to be `size of the box - size of the package`. The *total wasted space* is the sum of the space wasted in *all* the boxes.


* For example, if you have to fit packages with sizes `[2,3,5]` and the supplier offers boxes of sizes `[4,8]`, you can fit the packages of size-`2` and size-`3` into two boxes of size-`4` and the package with size-`5` into a box of size-`8`. This would result in a waste of `(4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6`.


Return _the *minimum total wasted space* by choosing the box supplier *optimally*, or _`-1` _if it is *impossible* to fit all the packages inside boxes. _Since the answer may be *large*, return it *modulo *`10^9^ + 7`.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* packages = [2,3,5], boxes = [[4,8],[2,8]]
*Output:* 6
*Explanation*: It is optimal to choose the first supplier, using two size-4 boxes and one size-8 box.
The total waste is (4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* packages = [2,3,5], boxes = [[1,4],[2,3],[3,4]]
*Output:* -1
*Explanation:* There is no box that the package of size 5 can fit in.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* packages = [3,5,8,10,11,12], boxes = [[12],[11,9],[10,5,14]]
*Output:* 9
*Explanation:* It is optimal to choose the third supplier, using two size-5 boxes, two size-10 boxes, and two size-14 boxes.
The total waste is (5-3) + (5-5) + (10-8) + (10-10) + (14-11) + (14-12) = 9.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == packages.length`
* `m == boxes.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= m <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= packages[i] <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= boxes[j].length <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= boxes[j][k] <= 10^5^`
* `sum(boxes[j].length) <= 10^5^`
* The elements in `boxes[j]` are *distinct*.
