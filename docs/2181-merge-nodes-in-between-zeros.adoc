= 2181. Merge Nodes in Between Zeros

https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-nodes-in-between-zeros/[LeetCode - 2181. Merge Nodes in Between Zeros ^]

You are given the `head` of a linked list, which contains a series of integers *separated* by `0`'s. The *beginning* and *end* of the linked list will have `Node.val == 0`.

For *every *two consecutive `0`'s, *merge* all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the *sum* of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any `0`'s.

Return _the_ `head` _of the modified linked list_.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/02/ex1-1.png" style="width: 600px; height: 41px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]
*Output:* [4,11]
*Explanation:* 
The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 3 + 1 = 4.
- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/02/ex2-1.png" style="width: 600px; height: 41px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* head = [0,1,0,3,0,2,2,0]
*Output:* [1,3,4]
*Explanation:* 
The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 1 = 1.
- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 3 = 3.
- The sum of the nodes marked in yellow: 2 + 2 = 4.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[3, 2 * 10^5^]`.
* `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`
* There are *no* two consecutive nodes with `Node.val == 0`.
* The *beginning* and *end* of the linked list have `Node.val == 0`.
