= 2350. Shortest Impossible Sequence of Rolls

https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-impossible-sequence-of-rolls/[LeetCode - 2350. Shortest Impossible Sequence of Rolls ^]

You are given an integer array `rolls` of length `n` and an integer `k`. You roll a `k` sided dice numbered from `1` to `k`, `n` times, where the result of the `i^th^` roll is `rolls[i]`.

Return_ the length of the *shortest* sequence of rolls so that there's no such <span data-keyword="subsequence-array">subsequence in _`rolls`.

A *sequence of rolls* of length `len` is the result of rolling a `k` sided dice `len` times.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* rolls = [4,2,1,2,3,3,2,4,1], k = 4
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* Every sequence of rolls of length 1, [1], [2], [3], [4], can be taken from rolls.
Every sequence of rolls of length 2, [1, 1], [1, 2], ..., [4, 4], can be taken from rolls.
The sequence [1, 4, 2] cannot be taken from rolls, so we return 3.
Note that there are other sequences that cannot be taken from rolls.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* rolls = [1,1,2,2], k = 2
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* Every sequence of rolls of length 1, [1], [2], can be taken from rolls.
The sequence [2, 1] cannot be taken from rolls, so we return 2.
Note that there are other sequences that cannot be taken from rolls but [2, 1] is the shortest.

----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* rolls = [1,1,3,2,2,2,3,3], k = 4
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* The sequence [4] cannot be taken from rolls, so we return 1.
Note that there are other sequences that cannot be taken from rolls but [4] is the shortest.

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == rolls.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= rolls[i] <= k <= 10^5^`
