= 1080. Insufficient Nodes in Root to Leaf Paths

https://leetcode.com/problems/insufficient-nodes-in-root-to-leaf-paths/[LeetCode - Insufficient Nodes in Root to Leaf Paths]

Given the `root` of a binary tree, consider all _root to leaf paths_: paths from the root to any leaf.  (A leaf is a node with no children.)

A `node` is _insufficient_ if *every* such root to leaf path intersecting this `node` has sum strictly less than `limit`.

Delete all insufficient nodes simultaneously, and return the root of the resulting binary tree.

*Note:*


. The given tree will have between `1` and `5000` nodes.
. `-10^5 <= node.val <= 10^5`
. `-10^9 <= limit <= 10^9`
