= 1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string-ii/[LeetCode - Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II]

Given a string `s`, a _k_ _duplicate removal_ consists of choosing `k` adjacent and equal letters from `s` and removing them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

We repeatedly make `k` duplicate removals on `s` until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.

It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* s = "abcd", k = 2
*Output:* "abcd"
*Explanation:* There's nothing to delete.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
*Output:* "aa"
*Explanation: 
*First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
*Output:* "ps"

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `2 <= k <= 10^4`
* `s` only contains lower case English letters.
