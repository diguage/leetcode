= 392. Is Subsequence

{leetcode}/problems/is-subsequence/[LeetCode - Is Subsequence^]


Given a string *s* and a string *t*, check if *s* is subsequence of *t*.



You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both *s* and *t*. *t* is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and *s* is a short string (<=100).



A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).


*Example 1:*


*s* = `"abc"`, *t* = `"ahbgdc"`


Return `true`.


*Example 2:*


*s* = `"axc"`, *t* = `"ahbgdc"`


Return `false`.


*Follow up:*


If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

双指针，当短指针到头也就是表明是子串。
