= Depth First Search 深度优先搜索

== Tree Depth First Search，树上的DFS

树形DFS基于深搜（Depth First Search (DFS)）技术来实现树的遍历。

咱们可以用递归（或是显式栈，如果你想用迭代方式的话）来记录遍历过程中访问过的父节点。

该模式的运行方式是从根节点开始，如果该节点不是叶子节点，我们需要干三件事：

. 需要区别我们是先处理根节点（pre-order，前序），处理孩子节点之间处理根节点（in-order，中序），还是处理完所有孩子再处理根节点（post-order，后序）。
. 递归处理当前节点的左右孩子。

识别树形DFS：

* 你需要按前中后序的DFS方式遍历树
* 如果该问题的解一般离叶子节点比较近。
