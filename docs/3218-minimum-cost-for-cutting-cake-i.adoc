= 3218. Minimum Cost for Cutting Cake I

{leetcode}/problems/minimum-cost-for-cutting-cake-i/[LeetCode - 3218. Minimum Cost for Cutting Cake I ^]

There is an `m x n` cake that needs to be cut into `1 x 1` pieces.

You are given integers `m`, `n`, and two arrays:


* `horizontalCut` of size `m - 1`, where `horizontalCut[i]` represents the cost to cut along the horizontal line `i`.
* `verticalCut` of size `n - 1`, where `verticalCut[j]` represents the cost to cut along the vertical line `j`.


In one operation, you can choose any piece of cake that is not yet a `1 x 1` square and perform one of the following cuts:


* Cut along a horizontal line `i` at a cost of `horizontalCut[i]`.
* Cut along a vertical line `j` at a cost of `verticalCut[j]`.


After the cut, the piece of cake is divided into two distinct pieces.

The cost of a cut depends only on the initial cost of the line and does not change.

Return the *minimum* total cost to cut the entire cake into `1 x 1` pieces.

 
*Example 1:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">m = 3, n = 2, horizontalCut = [1,3], verticalCut = [5]

*Output:* <span class="example-io">13

*Explanation:*

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/04/ezgifcom-animated-gif-maker-1.gif" style="width: 280px; height: 320px;" />


* Perform a cut on the vertical line 0 with cost 5, current total cost is 5.
* Perform a cut on the horizontal line 0 on `3 x 1` subgrid with cost 1.
* Perform a cut on the horizontal line 0 on `3 x 1` subgrid with cost 1.
* Perform a cut on the horizontal line 1 on `2 x 1` subgrid with cost 3.
* Perform a cut on the horizontal line 1 on `2 x 1` subgrid with cost 3.


The total cost is `5 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 13`.


*Example 2:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">m = 2, n = 2, horizontalCut = [7], verticalCut = [4]

*Output:* <span class="example-io">15

*Explanation:*


* Perform a cut on the horizontal line 0 with cost 7.
* Perform a cut on the vertical line 0 on `1 x 2` subgrid with cost 4.
* Perform a cut on the vertical line 0 on `1 x 2` subgrid with cost 4.


The total cost is `7 + 4 + 4 = 15`.


 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= m, n <= 20`
* `horizontalCut.length == m - 1`
* `verticalCut.length == n - 1`
* `1 <= horizontalCut[i], verticalCut[i] <= 10^3^`
