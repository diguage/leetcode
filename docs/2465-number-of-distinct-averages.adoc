= 2465. Number of Distinct Averages

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-distinct-averages/[LeetCode - 2465. Number of Distinct Averages ^]

You are given a *0-indexed* integer array `nums` of *even* length.

As long as `nums` is *not* empty, you must repetitively:


* Find the minimum number in `nums` and remove it.
* Find the maximum number in `nums` and remove it.
* Calculate the average of the two removed numbers.


The *average* of two numbers `a` and `b` is `(a + b) / 2`.


* For example, the average of `2` and `3` is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.


Return_ the number of *distinct* averages calculated using the above process_.

*Note* that when there is a tie for a minimum or maximum number, any can be removed.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [4,1,4,0,3,5]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:*
1. Remove 0 and 5, and the average is (0 + 5) / 2 = 2.5. Now, nums = [4,1,4,3].
2. Remove 1 and 4. The average is (1 + 4) / 2 = 2.5, and nums = [4,3].
3. Remove 3 and 4, and the average is (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5.
Since there are 2 distinct numbers among 2.5, 2.5, and 3.5, we return 2.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [1,100]
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:*
There is only one average to be calculated after removing 1 and 100, so we return 1.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `2 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `nums.length` is even.
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`
