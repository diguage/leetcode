= 2554. Maximum Number of Integers to Choose From a Range I

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-integers-to-choose-from-a-range-i/[LeetCode - 2554. Maximum Number of Integers to Choose From a Range I ^]

You are given an integer array `banned` and two integers `n` and `maxSum`. You are choosing some number of integers following the below rules:


* The chosen integers have to be in the range `[1, n]`.
* Each integer can be chosen *at most once*.
* The chosen integers should not be in the array `banned`.
* The sum of the chosen integers should not exceed `maxSum`.


Return _the *maximum* number of integers you can choose following the mentioned rules_.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* banned = [1,6,5], n = 5, maxSum = 6
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* You can choose the integers 2 and 4.
2 and 4 are from the range [1, 5], both did not appear in banned, and their sum is 6, which did not exceed maxSum.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* banned = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], n = 8, maxSum = 1
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* You cannot choose any integer while following the mentioned conditions.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* banned = [11], n = 7, maxSum = 50
*Output:* 7
*Explanation:* You can choose the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
They are from the range [1, 7], all did not appear in banned, and their sum is 28, which did not exceed maxSum.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= banned.length <= 10^4^`
* `1 <= banned[i], n <= 10^4^`
* `1 <= maxSum <= 10^9^`
