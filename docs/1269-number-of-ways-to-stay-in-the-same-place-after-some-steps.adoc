= 1269. Number of Ways to Stay in the Same Place After Some Steps

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-stay-in-the-same-place-after-some-steps/[LeetCode - Number of Ways to Stay in the Same Place After Some Steps]

You have a pointer at index `0` in an array of size `<font face="monospace">arrLen`. At each step, you can move 1 position to the left, 1 position to the right in the array or stay in the same place  (The pointer should not be placed outside the array at any time).

Given two integers `steps` and `arrLen`, return the number of ways such that your pointer still at index `0` after *exactly *`<font face="monospace">steps` steps.

Since the answer may be too large, return it *modulo* `10^9 + 7`.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* steps = 3, arrLen = 2
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* There are 4 differents ways to stay at index 0 after 3 steps.
Right, Left, Stay
Stay, Right, Left
Right, Stay, Left
Stay, Stay, Stay
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* steps = 2, arrLen = 4
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* There are 2 differents ways to stay at index 0 after 2 steps
Right, Left
Stay, Stay
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* steps = 4, arrLen = 2
*Output:* 8
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= steps <= 500`
* `1 <= arrLen <= 10^6`
