= 437. Path Sum III

https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/[LeetCode - Path Sum III]

You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

.Example:
[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

      10
     /  \
    *5*   *-3*
   */* *\*    *\*
  *3*   *2*   *11*
 / \   *\*
3  -2   *1*

Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11
