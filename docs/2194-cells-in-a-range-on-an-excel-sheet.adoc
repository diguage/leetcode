= 2194. Cells in a Range on an Excel Sheet

{leetcode}/problems/cells-in-a-range-on-an-excel-sheet/[LeetCode - 2194. Cells in a Range on an Excel Sheet ^]

A cell `(r, c)` of an excel sheet is represented as a string `"<col><row>"` where:


* `<col>` denotes the column number `c` of the cell. It is represented by *alphabetical letters*.

	
	* For example, the `1^st^` column is denoted by `'A'`, the `2^nd^` by `'B'`, the `3^rd^` by `'C'`, and so on.
	
	
* `<row>` is the row number `r` of the cell. The `r^th^` row is represented by the *integer* `r`.


You are given a string `s` in the format `"<col1><row1>:<col2><row2>"`, where `<col1>` represents the column `c1`, `<row1>` represents the row `r1`, `<col2>` represents the column `c2`, and `<row2>` represents the row `r2`, such that `r1 <= r2` and `c1 <= c2`.

Return _the *list of cells*_ `(x, y)` _such that_ `r1 <= x <= r2` _and_ `c1 <= y <= c2`. The cells should be represented as *strings* in the format mentioned above and be sorted in *non-decreasing* order first by columns and then by rows.

*Input:* s = "K1:L2"
*Output:* ["K1","K2","L1","L2"]
*Explanation:*
The above diagram shows the cells which should be present in the list.
The red arrows denote the order in which the cells should be presented.

*Input:* s = "A1:F1"
*Output:* ["A1","B1","C1","D1","E1","F1"]
*Explanation:*
The above diagram shows the cells which should be present in the list.
The red arrow denotes the order in which the cells should be presented.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `s.length == 5`
* `'A' <= s[0] <= s[3] <= 'Z'`
* `'1' <= s[1] <= s[4] <= '9'`
* `s` consists of uppercase English letters, digits and `':'`.
