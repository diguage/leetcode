= 88. Merge Sorted Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/[LeetCode - Merge Sorted Array]

Given two sorted integer arrays _nums1_ and _nums2_, merge _nums2_ into _nums1_ as one sorted array.

*Note:*


* The number of elements initialized in _nums1_ and _nums2_ are _m_ and _n_ respectively.
* You may assume that _nums1_ has enough space (size that is greater or equal to _m_ + _n_) to hold additional elements from _nums2_.


*Example:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

*Output:* [1,2,2,3,5,6]
