= 2644. Find the Maximum Divisibility Score

{leetcode}/problems/find-the-maximum-divisibility-score/[LeetCode - 2644. Find the Maximum Divisibility Score ^]

You are given two integer arrays `nums` and `divisors`.

The *divisibility score* of `divisors[i]` is the number of indices `j` such that `nums[j]` is divisible by `divisors[i]`.

Return the integer `divisors[i]` with the *maximum* divisibility score. If multiple integers have the maximum score, return the smallest one.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">nums = [2,9,15,50], divisors = [5,3,7,2]

*Output:* <span class="example-io">2

*Explanation:*

The divisibility score of `divisors[0]` is 2 since `nums[2]` and `nums[3]` are divisible by 5.

The divisibility score of `divisors[1]` is 2 since `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` are divisible by 3.

The divisibility score of `divisors[2]` is 0 since none of the numbers in `nums` is divisible by 7.

The divisibility score of `divisors[3]` is 2 since `nums[0]` and `nums[3]` are divisible by 2.

As `divisors[0]`, `divisors[1]`, and `divisors[3]` have the same divisibility score, we return the smaller one which is `divisors[3]`.


<strong class="example">Example 2:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">nums = [4,7,9,3,9], divisors = [5,2,3]

*Output:* <span class="example-io">3

*Explanation:*

The divisibility score of `divisors[0]` is 0 since none of numbers in `nums` is divisible by 5.

The divisibility score of `divisors[1]` is 1 since only `nums[0]` is divisible by 2.

The divisibility score of `divisors[2]` is 3 since `nums[2]`, `nums[3]` and `nums[4]` are divisible by 3.


<strong class="example">Example 3:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">nums = [20,14,21,10], divisors = [10,16,20]

*Output:* <span class="example-io">10

*Explanation:*

The divisibility score of `divisors[0]` is 2 since `nums[0]` and `nums[3]` are divisible by 10.

The divisibility score of `divisors[1]` is 0 since none of the numbers in `nums` is divisible by 16.

The divisibility score of `divisors[2]` is 1 since `nums[0]` is divisible by 20.


 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= nums.length, divisors.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= nums[i], divisors[i] <= 10^9^`
