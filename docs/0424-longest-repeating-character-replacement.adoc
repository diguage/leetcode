= 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/[LeetCode - Longest Repeating Character Replacement^]

Given a string `s` that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can perform at most `k` operations on that string.

In one operation, you can choose *any* character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character.

Find the length of the longest sub-string containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.

*Note:*


Both the string's length and _k_ will not exceed 10^4^.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*
s = "ABAB", k = 2

*Output:*
4

*Explanation:*
Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
----

 

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*
s = "AABABBA", k = 1

*Output:*
4

*Explanation:*
Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
