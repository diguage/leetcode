= 2581. Count Number of Possible Root Nodes

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-possible-root-nodes/[LeetCode - 2581. Count Number of Possible Root Nodes ^]

Alice has an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The tree is represented as a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where `edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `a<sub>i</sub>` and `b<sub>i</sub>` in the tree.

Alice wants Bob to find the root of the tree. She allows Bob to make several *guesses* about her tree. In one guess, he does the following:


* Chooses two *distinct* integers `u` and `v` such that there exists an edge `[u, v]` in the tree.
* He tells Alice that `u` is the *parent* of `v` in the tree.


Bob's guesses are represented by a 2D integer array `guesses` where `guesses[j] = [u<sub>j</sub>, v<sub>j</sub>]` indicates Bob guessed `u<sub>j</sub>` to be the parent of `v<sub>j</sub>`.

Alice being lazy, does not reply to each of Bob's guesses, but just says that *at least* `k` of his guesses are `true`.

Given the 2D integer arrays `edges`, `guesses` and the integer `k`, return _the *number of possible nodes* that can be the root of Alice's tree_. If there is no such tree, return `0`.

*Input:* edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[4,2]], guesses = [[1,3],[0,1],[1,0],[2,4]], k = 3
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* 
Root = 0, correct guesses = [1,3], [0,1], [2,4]
Root = 1, correct guesses = [1,3], [1,0], [2,4]
Root = 2, correct guesses = [1,3], [1,0], [2,4]
Root = 3, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,4]
Root = 4, correct guesses = [1,3], [1,0]
Considering 0, 1, or 2 as root node leads to 3 correct guesses.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/12/19/ex-2.png" style="width: 600px; height: 303px;" />

*Input:* edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]], guesses = [[1,0],[3,4],[2,1],[3,2]], k = 1
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* 
Root = 0, correct guesses = [3,4]
Root = 1, correct guesses = [1,0], [3,4]
Root = 2, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,1], [3,4]
Root = 3, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,1], [3,2], [3,4]
Root = 4, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,1], [3,2]
Considering any node as root will give at least 1 correct guess. 

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `edges.length == n - 1`
* `2 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= guesses.length <= 10^5^`
* `0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, u<sub>j</sub>, v<sub>j</sub> <= n - 1`
* `a<sub>i</sub> != b<sub>i</sub>`
* `u<sub>j</sub> != v<sub>j</sub>`
* `edges` represents a valid tree.
* `guesses[j]` is an edge of the tree.
* `guesses` is unique.
* `0 <= k <= guesses.length`
