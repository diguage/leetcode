= 1937. Maximum Number of Points with Cost

{leetcode}/problems/maximum-number-of-points-with-cost/[LeetCode - 1937. Maximum Number of Points with Cost ^]

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `points` (*0-indexed*). Starting with `0` points, you want to *maximize* the number of points you can get from the matrix.

To gain points, you must pick one cell in *each row*. Picking the cell at coordinates `(r, c)` will *add* `points[r][c]` to your score.

However, you will lose points if you pick a cell too far from the cell that you picked in the previous row. For every two adjacent rows `r` and `r + 1` (where `0 <= r < m - 1`), picking cells at coordinates `(r, c<sub>1</sub>)` and `(r + 1, c<sub>2</sub>)` will *subtract* `abs(c<sub>1</sub> - c<sub>2</sub>)` from your score.

Return _the *maximum* number of points you can achieve_.

`abs(x)` is defined as:


* `x` for `x >= 0`.
* `-x` for `x < 0`.

*Input:* points = [[1,2,3],[1,5,1],[3,1,1]]
*Output:* 9
*Explanation:*
The blue cells denote the optimal cells to pick, which have coordinates (0, 2), (1, 1), and (2, 0).
You add 3 + 5 + 3 = 11 to your score.
However, you must subtract abs(2 - 1) + abs(1 - 0) = 2 from your score.
Your final score is 11 - 2 = 9.

*Input:* points = [[1,5],[2,3],[4,2]]
*Output:* 11
*Explanation:*
The blue cells denote the optimal cells to pick, which have coordinates (0, 1), (1, 1), and (2, 0).
You add 5 + 3 + 4 = 12 to your score.
However, you must subtract abs(1 - 1) + abs(1 - 0) = 1 from your score.
Your final score is 12 - 1 = 11.

*Constraints:*


* `m == points.length`
* `n == points[r].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= m * n <= 10^5^`
* `0 <= points[r][c] <= 10^5^`
