= 3019. Number of Changing Keys

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-changing-keys/[LeetCode - 3019. Number of Changing Keys ^]

You are given a *0-indexed *string `s` typed by a user. Changing a key is defined as using a key different from the last used key. For example, `s = "ab"` has a change of a key while `s = "bBBb"` does not have any.

Return _the number of times the user had to change the key. _

*Note: *Modifiers like `shift` or `caps lock` won't be counted in changing the key that is if a user typed the letter `'a'` and then the letter `'A'` then it will not be considered as a changing of key.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "aAbBcC"
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* 
From s[0] = 'a' to s[1] = 'A', there is no change of key as caps lock or shift is not counted.
From s[1] = 'A' to s[2] = 'b', there is a change of key.
From s[2] = 'b' to s[3] = 'B', there is no change of key as caps lock or shift is not counted.
From s[3] = 'B' to s[4] = 'c', there is a change of key.
From s[4] = 'c' to s[5] = 'C', there is no change of key as caps lock or shift is not counted.

----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "AaAaAaaA"
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* There is no change of key since only the letters 'a' and 'A' are<!-- notionvc: 8849fe75-f31e-41dc-a2e0-b7d33d8427d2 --> pressed which does not require change of key.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= s.length <= 100`
* `s` consists of only upper case and lower case English letters.
