== 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/[LeetCode - Maximum Depth of Binary Tree]

思考题：尝试使用迭代方式来解决一下。

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

*Note:* A leaf is a node with no children.

*Example:*

Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
----

return its depth = 3.
