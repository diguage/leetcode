= 377. Combination Sum IV

https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iv/[LeetCode - Combination Sum IV]

Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

*Example:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
_*nums*_ = [1, 2, 3]
_*target*_ = 4

The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)

Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Therefore the output is _*7*_.

What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?


How does it change the problem?


What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?
