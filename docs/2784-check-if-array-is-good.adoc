= 2784. Check if Array is Good

{leetcode}/problems/check-if-array-is-good/[LeetCode - 2784. Check if Array is Good ^]

You are given an integer array `nums`. We consider an array *good *if it is a permutation of an array `base[n]`.

`base[n] = [1, 2, ..., n - 1, n, n] `(in other words, it is an array of length `n + 1` which contains `1` to `n - 1 `exactly once, plus two occurrences of `n`). For example, `base[1] = [1, 1]` and` base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3]`.

Return `true` _if the given array is good, otherwise return__ _`false`.

*Note: *A permutation of integers represents an arrangement of these numbers.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [2, 1, 3]
*Output:* false
*Explanation:* Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. However, base[3] has four elements but array nums has three. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3]. So the answer is false.

----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [1, 3, 3, 2]
*Output:* true
*Explanation:* Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3] (by swapping the second and fourth elements in nums, we reach base[3]). Therefore, the answer is true.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [1, 1]
*Output:* true
*Explanation:* Since the maximum element of the array is 1, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 1. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[1] = [1, 1]. Therefore, the answer is true.
----

<strong class="example">Example 4:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1]
*Output:* false
*Explanation:* Since the maximum element of the array is 4, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 4. However, base[4] has five elements but array nums has six. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[4] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]. So the answer is false.

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `1 <= num[i] <= 200`
