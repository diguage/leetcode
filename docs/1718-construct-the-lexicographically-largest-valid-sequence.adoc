= 1718. Construct the Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-lexicographically-largest-valid-sequence/[LeetCode - 1718. Construct the Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence ^]

Given an integer `n`, find a sequence that satisfies all of the following:


* The integer `1` occurs once in the sequence.
* Each integer between `2` and `n` occurs twice in the sequence.
* For every integer `i` between `2` and `n`, the *distance* between the two occurrences of `i` is exactly `i`.


The *distance* between two numbers on the sequence, `a[i]` and `a[j]`, is the absolute difference of their indices, `|j - i|`.

Return _the *lexicographically largest* sequence__. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there is always a solution. _

A sequence `a` is lexicographically larger than a sequence `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, sequence `a` has a number greater than the corresponding number in `b`. For example, `[0,1,9,0]` is lexicographically larger than `[0,1,5,6]` because the first position they differ is at the third number, and `9` is greater than `5`.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 3
*Output:* [3,1,2,3,2]
*Explanation:* [2,3,2,1,3] is also a valid sequence, but [3,1,2,3,2] is the lexicographically largest valid sequence.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 5
*Output:* [5,3,1,4,3,5,2,4,2]
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 20`
