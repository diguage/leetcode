https://leetcode.com/problems/new-21-game/[LeetCode - New 21 Game]

Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with `0` points, and draws numbers while she has less than `K` points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range `[1, W]`, where `W` is an integer.  Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets `K` or more points.  What is the probability that she has `N` or less points?

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* N = 10, K = 1, W = 10
*Output:* 1.00000
*Explanation:* Alice gets a single card, then stops.

----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* N = 6, K = 1, W = 10
*Output:* 0.60000
*Explanation:* Alice gets a single card, then stops.
In 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6 points.

----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* N = 21, K = 17, W = 10
*Output:* 0.73278
----

*Note:*


. `0 <= K <= N <= 10000`
. `1 <= W <= 10000`
. Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within `10^-5` of the correct answer.
