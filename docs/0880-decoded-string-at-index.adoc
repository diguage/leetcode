== 880. Decoded String at Index

https://leetcode.com/problems/decoded-string-at-index/[LeetCode - Decoded String at Index]

An encoded string `S` is given.  To find and write the _decoded_ string to a tape, the encoded string is read *one character at a time* and the following steps are taken:


* If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
* If the character read is a digit (say `d`), the entire current tape is repeatedly written `d-1` more times in total.


Now for some encoded string `S`, and an index `K`, find and return the `K`-th letter (1 indexed) in the decoded string.

 


*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* S = "leet2code3", K = 10
*Output:* "o"
*Explanation:*
The decoded string is "leetleetcodeleetleetcodeleetleetcode".
The 10th letter in the string is "o".
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* S = "ha22", K = 5
*Output:* "h"
*Explanation:*
The decoded string is "hahahaha".  The 5th letter is "h".
----


*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* S = "a2345678999999999999999", K = 1
*Output:* "a"
*Explanation:*
The decoded string is "a" repeated 8301530446056247680 times.  The 1st letter is "a".
----

 

*Note:*


* `2 <= S.length <= 100`
* `S` will only contain lowercase letters and digits `2` through `9`.
* `S` starts with a letter.
* `1 <= K <= 10^9`
* The decoded string is guaranteed to have less than `2^63` letters.
