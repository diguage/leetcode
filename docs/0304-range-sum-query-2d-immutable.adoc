= 304. Range Sum Query 2D - Immutable

https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-2d-immutable/[LeetCode - Range Sum Query 2D - Immutable]

Given a 2D matrix _matrix_, find the sum of the elements inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner (_row_1, _col_1) and lower right corner (_row_2, _col_2).

[.small]#The above rectangle (with the red border) is defined by (row1, col1) = *(2, 1)* and (row2, col2) = *(4, 3)*, which contains sum = *8*.#


*Example:*
[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
Given matrix = [
  [3, 0, 1, 4, 2],
  [5, 6, 3, 2, 1],
  [1, 2, 0, 1, 5],
  [4, 1, 0, 1, 7],
  [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]
]

sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3) -> 8
sumRegion(1, 1, 2, 2) -> 11
sumRegion(1, 2, 2, 4) -> 12
----


*Note:*

. You may assume that the matrix does not change.
. There are many calls to _sumRegion_ function.
. You may assume that _row_1 ≤ _row_2 and _col_1 ≤ _col_2.
