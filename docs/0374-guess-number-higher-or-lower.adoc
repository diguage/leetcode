https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/[LeetCode - Guess Number Higher or Lower]

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from *1* to *_n_*. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API `guess(int num)` which returns 3 possible results (`-1`, `1`, or `0`):

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]

-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
