= 1559. Detect Cycles in 2D Grid

{leetcode}/problems/detect-cycles-in-2d-grid/[LeetCode - 1559. Detect Cycles in 2D Grid ^]

Given a 2D array of characters `grid` of size `m x n`, you need to find if there exists any cycle consisting of the *same value* in `grid`.

A cycle is a path of *length 4 or more* in the grid that starts and ends at the same cell. From a given cell, you can move to one of the cells adjacent to it - in one of the four directions (up, down, left, or right), if it has the *same value* of the current cell.

Also, you cannot move to the cell that you visited in your last move. For example, the cycle `(1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1)` is invalid because from `(1, 2)` we visited `(1, 1)` which was the last visited cell.

Return `true` if any cycle of the same value exists in `grid`, otherwise, return `false`.

*Input:* grid = [["a","a","a","a"],["a","b","b","a"],["a","b","b","a"],["a","a","a","a"]]
*Output:* true
*Explanation: *There are two valid cycles shown in different colors in the image below:

*Example 2:*

*<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/15/22.png" style="width: 236px; height: 154px;" />*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* grid = [["c","c","c","a"],["c","d","c","c"],["c","c","e","c"],["f","c","c","c"]]
*Output:* true
*Explanation: *There is only one valid cycle highlighted in the image below:
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/15/2.png" style="width: 229px; height: 157px;" />
----

*Example 3:*

*<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/15/3.png" style="width: 183px; height: 120px;" />*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* grid = [["a","b","b"],["b","z","b"],["b","b","a"]]
*Output:* false
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 500`
* `grid` consists only of lowercase English letters.
