= 985. Sum of Even Numbers After Queries

{leetcode}/problems/sum-of-even-numbers-after-queries/[LeetCode - Sum of Even Numbers After Queries^]

We have an array `A` of integers, and an array `queries` of queries.

For the `i`-th query `val = queries[i][0], index = queries[i][1]`, we add <font face="monospace">val to `A[index]`.  Then, the answer to the `i`-th query is the sum of the even values of `A`.

_(Here, the given `index = queries[i][1]` is a 0-based index, and each query permanently modifies the array `A`.)_

Return the answer to all queries.  Your `answer` array should have `answer[i]` as the answer to the `i`-th query.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* A = [1,2,3,4], queries = [[1,0],[-3,1],[-4,0],[2,3]]
*Output:* [8,6,2,4]
*Explanation:*
At the beginning, the array is [1,2,3,4].
After adding 1 to A[0], the array is [2,2,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
After adding -3 to A[1], the array is [2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 4 = 6.
After adding -4 to A[0], the array is [-2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is -2 + 4 = 2.
After adding 2 to A[3], the array is [-2,-1,3,6], and the sum of even values is -2 + 6 = 4.

*Note:*


. `1 <= A.length <= 10000`
. `-10000 <= A[i] <= 10000`
. `1 <= queries.length <= 10000`
. `-10000 <= queries[i][0] <= 10000`
. `0 <= queries[i][1] < A.length`
