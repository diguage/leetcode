https://leetcode.com/problems/uncommon-words-from-two-sentences/[LeetCode - Uncommon Words from Two Sentences]

We are given two sentences `A` and `B`.  (A _sentence_ is a string of space separated words.  Each _word_ consists only of lowercase letters.)

A word is _uncommon_ if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Return a list of all uncommon words. 

You may return the list in any order.

 





*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* A = "this apple is sweet", B = "this apple is sour"
*Output:* ["sweet","sour"]
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* A = "apple apple", B = "banana"
*Output:* ["banana"]
----

 

*Note:*


. `0 <= A.length <= 200`
. `0 <= B.length <= 200`
. `A` and `B` both contain only spaces and lowercase letters.
