= 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/[LeetCode - Find All Anagrams in a String]

Given a string `s` and a *non-empty* string `p`, find all the start indices of **p**'s anagrams in `s`.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

.Example 1:
----
Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
----

.Example 2:
----
Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

Given a string *s* and a *non-empty* string *p*, find all the start indices of *p*'s anagrams in *s*.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings *s* and *p* will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

*Example 1:*
[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
