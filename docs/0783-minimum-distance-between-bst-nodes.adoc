= 783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/[LeetCode - Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes]

Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node `root`, return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

*Example :*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* root = [4,2,6,1,3,null,null]
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:*
Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.

The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following diagram:

          4
        /   \
      2      6
     / \    
    1   3  

while the minimum difference in this tree is 1, it occurs between node 1 and node 2, also between node 3 and node 2.
----

*Note:*


. The size of the BST will be between 2 and `100`.
. The BST is always valid, each node's value is an integer, and each node's value is different.
