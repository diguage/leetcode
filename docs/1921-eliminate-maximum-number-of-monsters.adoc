= 1921. Eliminate Maximum Number of Monsters

{leetcode}/problems/eliminate-maximum-number-of-monsters/[LeetCode - 1921. Eliminate Maximum Number of Monsters ^]

You are playing a video game where you are defending your city from a group of `n` monsters. You are given a *0-indexed* integer array `dist` of size `n`, where `dist[i]` is the *initial distance* in kilometers of the `i^th^` monster from the city.

The monsters walk toward the city at a *constant* speed. The speed of each monster is given to you in an integer array `speed` of size `n`, where `speed[i]` is the speed of the `i^th^` monster in kilometers per minute.

You have a weapon that, once fully charged, can eliminate a *single* monster. However, the weapon takes *one minute* to charge. The weapon is fully charged at the very start.

You lose when any monster reaches your city. If a monster reaches the city at the exact moment the weapon is fully charged, it counts as a *loss*, and the game ends before you can use your weapon.

Return _the *maximum* number of monsters that you can eliminate before you lose, or _`n`_ if you can eliminate all the monsters before they reach the city._

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* dist = [1,3,4], speed = [1,1,1]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:*
In the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [1,3,4]. You eliminate the first monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,2,3]. You eliminate the second monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,X,2]. You eliminate the third monster.
All 3 monsters can be eliminated.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* dist = [1,1,2,3], speed = [1,1,1,1]
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:*
In the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [1,1,2,3]. You eliminate the first monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,0,1,2], so you lose.
You can only eliminate 1 monster.

----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* dist = [3,2,4], speed = [5,3,2]
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:*
In the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [3,2,4]. You eliminate the first monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,0,2], so you lose.
You can only eliminate 1 monster.

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == dist.length == speed.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= dist[i], speed[i] <= 10^5^`
