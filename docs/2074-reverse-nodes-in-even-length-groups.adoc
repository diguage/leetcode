= 2074. Reverse Nodes in Even Length Groups

{leetcode}/problems/reverse-nodes-in-even-length-groups/[LeetCode - 2074. Reverse Nodes in Even Length Groups ^]

You are given the `head` of a linked list.

The nodes in the linked list are *sequentially* assigned to *non-empty* groups whose lengths form the sequence of the natural numbers (`1, 2, 3, 4, ...`). The *length* of a group is the number of nodes assigned to it. In other words,


* The `1^st^` node is assigned to the first group.
* The `2^nd^` and the `3^rd^` nodes are assigned to the second group.
* The `4^th^`, `5^th^`, and `6^th^` nodes are assigned to the third group, and so on.


Note that the length of the last group may be less than or equal to `1 + the length of the second to last group`.

*Reverse* the nodes in each group with an *even* length, and return _the_ `head` _of the modified linked list_.

*Input:* head = [5,2,6,3,9,1,7,3,8,4]
*Output:* [5,6,2,3,9,1,4,8,3,7]
*Explanation:*
- The length of the first group is 1, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.
- The length of the second group is 2, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.
- The length of the third group is 3, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.
- The length of the last group is 4, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]

*Input:* head = [1,1,0,6]
*Output:* [1,0,1,6]
*Explanation:*
- The length of the first group is 1. No reversal occurs.
- The length of the second group is 2. The nodes are reversed.
- The length of the last group is 1. No reversal occurs.

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* head = [1,1,0,6,5]
*Output:* [1,0,1,5,6]
*Explanation:*
- The length of the first group is 1. No reversal occurs.
- The length of the second group is 2. The nodes are reversed.
- The length of the last group is 2. The nodes are reversed.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 10^5^]`.
* `0 <= Node.val <= 10^5^`
