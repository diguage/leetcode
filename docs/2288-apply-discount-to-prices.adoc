https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-discount-to-prices/[LeetCode - 2288. Apply Discount to Prices ^]

A *sentence* is a string of single-space separated words where each word can contain digits, lowercase letters, and the dollar sign `'$'`. A word represents a *price* if it is a sequence of digits preceded by a dollar sign.


* For example, `"$100"`, `"$23"`, and `"$6"` represent prices while `"100"`, `"$"`, and `"$1e5"` do not.


You are given a string `sentence` representing a sentence and an integer `discount`. For each word representing a price, apply a discount of `discount%` on the price and *update* the word in the sentence. All updated prices should be represented with *exactly two* decimal places.

Return _a string representing the modified sentence_.

Note that all prices will contain *at most* `10` digits.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* sentence = "there are $1 $2 and 5$ candies in the shop", discount = 50
*Output:* "there are $0.50 $1.00 and 5$ candies in the shop"
*Explanation:* 
The words which represent prices are "$1" and "$2". 
- A 50% discount on "$1" yields "$0.50", so "$1" is replaced by "$0.50".
- A 50% discount on "$2" yields "$1". Since we need to have exactly 2 decimal places after a price, we replace "$2" with "$1.00".
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* sentence = "1 2 $3 4 $5 $6 7 8$ $9 $10$", discount = 100
*Output:* "1 2 $0.00 4 $0.00 $0.00 7 8$ $0.00 $10$"
*Explanation:* 
Applying a 100% discount on any price will result in 0.
The words representing prices are "$3", "$5", "$6", and "$9".
Each of them is replaced by "$0.00".
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= sentence.length <= 10^5^`
* `sentence` consists of lowercase English letters, digits, `' '`, and `'$'`.
* `sentence` does not have leading or trailing spaces.
* All words in `sentence` are separated by a single space.
* All prices will be *positive* numbers without leading zeros.
* All prices will have *at most* `10` digits.
* `0 <= discount <= 100`
