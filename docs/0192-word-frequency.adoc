= 192. Word Frequency

https://leetcode.com/problems/word-frequency/[LeetCode - Word Frequency]

Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file `words.txt`.

For simplicity sake, you may assume:


* `words.txt` contains only lowercase characters and space `' '` characters.
* Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
* Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.


*Example:*

Assume that `words.txt` has the following content:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
the day is sunny the the
the sunny is is
----

Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
the 4
is 3
sunny 2
day 1
----

*Note:*


* Don't worry about handling ties, it is guaranteed that each word's frequency count is unique.
* Could you write it in one-line using <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-4.html">Unix pipes</a>?
