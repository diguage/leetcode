= 2415. Reverse Odd Levels of Binary Tree

{leetcode}/problems/reverse-odd-levels-of-binary-tree/[LeetCode - 2415. Reverse Odd Levels of Binary Tree ^]

Given the `root` of a *perfect* binary tree, reverse the node values at each *odd* level of the tree.


* For example, suppose the node values at level 3 are `[2,1,3,4,7,11,29,18]`, then it should become `[18,29,11,7,4,3,1,2]`.


Return _the root of the reversed tree_.

A binary tree is *perfect* if all parent nodes have two children and all leaves are on the same level.

The *level* of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the root node.

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* root = [2,3,5,8,13,21,34]
*Output:* [2,5,3,8,13,21,34]
*Explanation:* 
The tree has only one odd level.
The nodes at level 1 are 3, 5 respectively, which are reversed and become 5, 3.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/07/28/second_case3.png" style="width: 591px; height: 111px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* root = [7,13,11]
*Output:* [7,11,13]
*Explanation:* 
The nodes at level 1 are 13, 11, which are reversed and become 11, 13.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* root = [0,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2]
*Output:* [0,2,1,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1]
*Explanation:* 
The odd levels have non-zero values.
The nodes at level 1 were 1, 2, and are 2, 1 after the reversal.
The nodes at level 3 were 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, and are 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1 after the reversal.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 2^14^]`.
* `0 <= Node.val <= 10^5^`
* `root` is a *perfect* binary tree.
