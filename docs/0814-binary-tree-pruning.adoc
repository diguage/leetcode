= 814. Binary Tree Pruning

https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-pruning/[LeetCode - Binary Tree Pruning]

We are given the head node `root` of a binary tree, where additionally every node's value is either a 0 or a 1.

Return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.

(Recall that the subtree of a node X is X, plus every node that is a descendant of X.)

*Example 1:*
*Input:* [1,null,0,0,1]
*Output:* [1,null,0,null,1]
 
*Explanation:* 
Only the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1".
The diagram on the right represents the answer.

*Note: *


* The binary tree will have at most `100 nodes`.
* The value of each node will only be `0` or `1`.
