= 2132. Stamping the Grid

https://leetcode.com/problems/stamping-the-grid/[LeetCode - 2132. Stamping the Grid ^]

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid` where each cell is either `0` (empty) or `1` (occupied).

You are then given stamps of size `stampHeight x stampWidth`. We want to fit the stamps such that they follow the given *restrictions* and *requirements*:


* Cover all the *empty* cells.
* Do not cover any of the *occupied* cells.
* We can put as *many* stamps as we want.
* Stamps can *overlap* with each other.
* Stamps are not allowed to be *rotated*.
* Stamps must stay completely *inside* the grid.


Return `true` _if it is possible to fit the stamps while following the given restrictions and requirements. Otherwise, return_ `false`.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/03/ex1.png" style="width: 180px; height: 237px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]], stampHeight = 4, stampWidth = 3
*Output:* true
*Explanation:* We have two overlapping stamps (labeled 1 and 2 in the image) that are able to cover all the empty cells.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/03/ex2.png" style="width: 170px; height: 179px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* grid = [[1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]], stampHeight = 2, stampWidth = 2 
*Output:* false 
*Explanation:* There is no way to fit the stamps onto all the empty cells without the stamps going outside the grid.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[r].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= m * n <= 2 * 10^5^`
* `grid[r][c]` is either `0` or `1`.
* `1 <= stampHeight, stampWidth <= 10^5^`
