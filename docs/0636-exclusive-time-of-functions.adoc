= 636. Exclusive Time of Functions

https://leetcode.com/problems/exclusive-time-of-functions/[LeetCode - Exclusive Time of Functions]

On a *single threaded* CPU, we execute some functions.  Each function has a unique id between `0` and `N-1`.

We store logs in timestamp order that describe when a function is entered or exited.

Each log is a string with this format: `"{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}"`.  For example, `"0:start:3"` means the function with id `0` *started at the beginning* of timestamp `3`.  `"1:end:2"` means the function with id `1` *ended at the end* of timestamp `2`.

A function's _exclusive time_ is the number of units of time spent in this function.  Note that this does *not* include any recursive calls to child functions.

The CPU is *single threaded* which means that only one function is being executed at a given time unit.

Return the exclusive time of each function, sorted by their function id.

*Input:*
n = 2
logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]
*Output:* [3, 4]
*Explanation:*
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
Now function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes 4 units of time and ends at time 5.
Function 0 is running again at the beginning of time 6, and also ends at the end of time 6, thus executing for 1 unit of time. 
So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.

*Note:*


. `1 <= n <= 100`
. Two functions won't start or end at the same time.
. Functions will always log when they exit.
