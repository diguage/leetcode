= 1022. Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers

https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-root-to-leaf-binary-numbers/[LeetCode - Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers]

Given a binary tree, each node has value `0` or `1`.  Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.  For example, if the path is `0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1`, then this could represent `01101` in binary, which is `13`.

For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf.

Return the sum of these numbers.

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
*Output:* 22
*Explanation:* (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22
----

 

*Note:*


. The number of nodes in the tree is between `1` and `1000`.
. node.val is `0` or `1`.
. The answer will not exceed `2^31 - 1`.
