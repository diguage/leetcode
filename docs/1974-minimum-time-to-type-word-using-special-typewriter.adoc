= 1974. Minimum Time to Type Word Using Special Typewriter

{leetcode}/problems/minimum-time-to-type-word-using-special-typewriter/[LeetCode - 1974. Minimum Time to Type Word Using Special Typewriter ^]

There is a special typewriter with lowercase English letters `'a'` to `'z'` arranged in a *circle* with a *pointer*. A character can *only* be typed if the pointer is pointing to that character. The pointer is *initially* pointing to the character `'a'`.
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/31/chart.jpg" style="width: 530px; height: 410px;" />
Each second, you may perform one of the following operations:


* Move the pointer one character *counterclockwise* or *clockwise*.
* Type the character the pointer is *currently* on.


Given a string `word`, return the* minimum* number of seconds to type out the characters in `word`.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* word = "abc"
*Output:* 5
*Explanation: 
*The characters are printed as follows:
- Type the character 'a' in 1 second since the pointer is initially on 'a'.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'b' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'c' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'c' in 1 second.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* word = "bza"
*Output:* 7
*Explanation:
*The characters are printed as follows:
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'b' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'z' in 2 seconds.
- Type the character 'z' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'a' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'a' in 1 second.
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* word = "zjpc"
*Output:* 34
*Explanation:*
The characters are printed as follows:
- Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'z' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'z' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'j' in 10 seconds.
- Type the character 'j' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'p' in 6 seconds.
- Type the character 'p' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'c' in 13 seconds.
- Type the character 'c' in 1 second.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= word.length <= 100`
* `word` consists of lowercase English letters.
