= 600. Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones

https://leetcode.com/problems/non-negative-integers-without-consecutive-ones/[LeetCode - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones]

Given a positive integer n, find the number of *non-negative* integers less than or equal to n, whose binary representations do NOT contain *consecutive ones*.

*Example 1:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* 5
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* 
Here are the non-negative integers <= 5 with their corresponding binary representations:
0 : 0
1 : 1
2 : 10
3 : 11
4 : 100
5 : 101
Among them, only integer 3 disobeys the rule (two consecutive ones) and the other 5 satisfy the rule.

*Note:*
1 <= n <= 10^9^
