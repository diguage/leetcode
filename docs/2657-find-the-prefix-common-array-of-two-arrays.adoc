= 2657. Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-prefix-common-array-of-two-arrays/[LeetCode - 2657. Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays ^]

You are given two *0-indexed *integer* *permutations `A` and `B` of length `n`.

A *prefix common array* of `A` and `B` is an array `C` such that `C[i]` is equal to the count of numbers that are present at or before the index `i` in both `A` and `B`.

Return _the *prefix common array* of _`A`_ and _`B`.

A sequence of `n` integers is called a *permutation* if it contains all integers from `1` to `n` exactly once.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* A = [1,3,2,4], B = [3,1,2,4]
*Output:* [0,2,3,4]
*Explanation:* At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
At i = 1: 1 and 3 are common in A and B, so C[1] = 2.
At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.
At i = 3: 1, 2, 3, and 4 are common in A and B, so C[3] = 4.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* A = [2,3,1], B = [3,1,2]
*Output:* [0,1,3]
*Explanation:* At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
At i = 1: only 3 is common in A and B, so C[1] = 1.
At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= A.length == B.length == n <= 50`
* `1 <= A[i], B[i] <= n`
* `It is guaranteed that A and B are both a permutation of n integers.`
