= 232. Implement Queue using Stacks

https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/[LeetCode - Implement Queue using Stacks]

Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.


* push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
* pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
* peek() -- Get the front element.
* empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.


*Example:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
MyQueue queue = new MyQueue();

queue.push(1);
queue.push(2);  
queue.peek();  // returns 1
queue.pop();   // returns 1
queue.empty(); // returns false
----

*Notes:*


* You must use _only_ standard operations of a stack -- which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
* Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
* You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).
