== 87. Scramble String

https://leetcode.com/problems/scramble-string/[LeetCode - Scramble String]

Given a string _s1_, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.

Below is one possible representation of _s1_ = `"great"`:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
    great
   /    \
  gr    eat
 / \    /  \
g   r  e   at
           / \
          a   t

----

To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.

For example, if we choose the node `"gr"` and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string `"rgeat"`.

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
    rgeat
   /    \
  rg    eat
 / \    /  \
r   g  e   at
           / \
          a   t

----

We say that `"rgeat"` is a scrambled string of `"great"`.

Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes `"eat"` and `"at"`, it produces a scrambled string `"rgtae"`.

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
    rgtae
   /    \
  rg    tae
 / \    /  \
r   g  ta  e
       / \
      t   a

----

We say that `"rgtae"` is a scrambled string of `"great"`.

Given two strings _s1_ and _s2_ of the same length, determine if _s2_ is a scrambled string of _s1_.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s1 = "great", s2 = "rgeat"
*Output:* true

----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s1 = "abcde", s2 = "caebd"
*Output:* false
----
