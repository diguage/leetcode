= 757. Set Intersection Size At Least Two

https://leetcode.com/problems/set-intersection-size-at-least-two/[LeetCode - Set Intersection Size At Least Two]


An integer interval `[a, b]` (for integers `a < b`) is a set of all consecutive integers from `a` to `b`, including `a` and `b`.

Find the minimum size of a set S such that for every integer interval A in `intervals`, the intersection of S with A has size at least 2.


*Example 1:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* intervals = [[1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 5]]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:*
Consider the set S = {2, 3, 4}.  For each interval, there are at least 2 elements from S in the interval.
Also, there isn't a smaller size set that fulfills the above condition.
Thus, we output the size of this set, which is 3.

*Example 2:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* intervals = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [4, 5]]
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:*
An example of a minimum sized set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
----


*Note:*
. `intervals` will have length in range `[1, 3000]`.
. `intervals[i]` will have length `2`, representing some integer interval.
. `intervals[i][j]` will be an integer in `[0, 10^8]`.
