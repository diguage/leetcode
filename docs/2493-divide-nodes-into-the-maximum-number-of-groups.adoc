= 2493. Divide Nodes Into the Maximum Number of Groups

{leetcode}/problems/divide-nodes-into-the-maximum-number-of-groups/[LeetCode - 2493. Divide Nodes Into the Maximum Number of Groups ^]

You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes in an *undirected* graph. The nodes are labeled from `1` to `n`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [a<sub>i, </sub>b<sub>i</sub>]` indicates that there is a *bidirectional* edge between nodes `a<sub>i</sub>` and `b<sub>i</sub>`. *Notice* that the given graph may be disconnected.

Divide the nodes of the graph into `m` groups (*1-indexed*) such that:


* Each node in the graph belongs to exactly one group.
* For every pair of nodes in the graph that are connected by an edge `[a<sub>i, </sub>b<sub>i</sub>]`, if `a<sub>i</sub>` belongs to the group with index `x`, and `b<sub>i</sub>` belongs to the group with index `y`, then `|y - x| = 1`.


Return _the maximum number of groups (i.e., maximum _`m`_) into which you can divide the nodes_. Return `-1` _if it is impossible to group the nodes with the given conditions_.

*Input:* n = 6, edges = [[1,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,6],[2,3],[4,6]]
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* As shown in the image we:
- Add node 5 to the first group.
- Add node 1 to the second group.
- Add nodes 2 and 4 to the third group.
- Add nodes 3 and 6 to the fourth group.
We can see that every edge is satisfied.
It can be shown that that if we create a fifth group and move any node from the third or fourth group to it, at least on of the edges will not be satisfied.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 3, edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
*Output:* -1
*Explanation:* If we add node 1 to the first group, node 2 to the second group, and node 3 to the third group to satisfy the first two edges, we can see that the third edge will not be satisfied.
It can be shown that no grouping is possible.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 500`
* `1 <= edges.length <= 10^4^`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> <= n`
* `a<sub>i</sub> != b<sub>i</sub>`
* There is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.
