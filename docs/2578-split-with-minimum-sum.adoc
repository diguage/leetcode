= 2578. Split With Minimum Sum

{leetcode}/problems/split-with-minimum-sum/[LeetCode - 2578. Split With Minimum Sum ^]

Given a positive integer `num`, split it into two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` such that:


* The concatenation of `num1` and `num2` is a permutation of `num`.

	
	* In other words, the sum of the number of occurrences of each digit in `num1` and `num2` is equal to the number of occurrences of that digit in `num`.
	
	
* `num1` and `num2` can contain leading zeros.


Return _the *minimum* possible sum of_ `num1` _and_ `num2`.

*Notes:*


* It is guaranteed that `num` does not contain any leading zeros.
* The order of occurrence of the digits in `num1` and `num2` may differ from the order of occurrence of `num`.


 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* num = 4325
*Output:* 59
*Explanation:* We can split 4325 so that `num1` is 24 and `num2` is 35, giving a sum of 59. We can prove that 59 is indeed the minimal possible sum.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* num = 687
*Output:* 75
*Explanation:* We can split 687 so that `num1` is 68 and `num2` is 7, which would give an optimal sum of 75.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `10 <= num <= 10^9^`
