== 1337. The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix

https://leetcode.com/problems/the-k-weakest-rows-in-a-matrix/[LeetCode - The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix]

Given a `m * n` matrix `mat` of _ones_ (representing soldiers) and _zeros_ (representing civilians), return the indexes of the `k` weakest rows in the matrix ordered from the weakest to the strongest.

A row _*i*_ is weaker than row _*j*_, if the number of soldiers in row _*i*_ is less than the number of soldiers in row _*j*_, or they have the same number of soldiers but _*i*_ is less than _*j*_. Soldiers are *always* stand in the frontier of a row, that is, always _ones_ may appear first and then _zeros_.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* mat = 
[[1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,0],
 [1,0,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,1]], 
k = 3
*Output:* [2,0,3]
*Explanation:* 
The number of soldiers for each row is: 
row 0 -> 2 
row 1 -> 4 
row 2 -> 1 
row 3 -> 2 
row 4 -> 5 
Rows ordered from the weakest to the strongest are [2,0,3,1,4]
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* mat = 
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1],
 [1,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0]], 
k = 2
*Output:* [0,2]
*Explanation:* 
The number of soldiers for each row is: 
row 0 -> 1 
row 1 -> 4 
row 2 -> 1 
row 3 -> 1 
Rows ordered from the weakest to the strongest are [0,2,3,1]
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `m == mat.length`
* `n == mat[i].length`
* `<font face="monospace">2 <= n, m <= 100`
* `1 <= k <= m`
* `matrix[i][j]` is either 0 *or* 1.
