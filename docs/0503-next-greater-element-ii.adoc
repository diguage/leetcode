= 503. Next Greater Element II

https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/[LeetCode - Next Greater Element II^]

Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.


*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [1,2,1]
*Output:* [2,-1,2]
*Explanation:* The first 1's next greater number is 2; </br>The number 2 can't find next greater number; </br>The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
----


*Note:*

The length of given array won't exceed 10000.
