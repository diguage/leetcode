= 997. Find the Town Judge

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/[LeetCode - Find the Town Judge]

In a town, there are `N` people labelled from `1` to `N`.  There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:


. The town judge trusts nobody.
. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.


You are given `trust`, an array of pairs `trust[i] = [a, b]` representing that the person labelled `a` trusts the person labelled `b`.

If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the label of the town judge.  Otherwise, return `-1`.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* N = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
*Output:* 2
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
*Output:* 3
----


*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
*Output:* -1
----


*Example 4:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* N = 3, trust = [[1,2],[2,3]]
*Output:* -1
----


*Example 5:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* N = 4, trust = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[4,3]]
*Output:* 3
----

 





*Note:*


. `1 <= N <= 1000`
. `trust.length <= 10000`
. `trust[i]` are all different
. `trust[i][0] != trust[i][1]`
. `1 <= trust[i][0], trust[i][1] <= N`
