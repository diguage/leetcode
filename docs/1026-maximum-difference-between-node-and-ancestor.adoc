= 1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-node-and-ancestor/[LeetCode - Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor^]

Given the `root` of a binary tree, find the maximum value `V` for which there exists *different* nodes `A` and `B` where `V = |A.val - B.val|` and `A` is an ancestor of `B`.

(A node A is an ancestor of B if either: any child of A is equal to B, or any child of A is an ancestor of B.)

*Input:* [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
*Output:* 7
*Explanation:*
We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
|8 - 3| = 5
|3 - 7| = 4
|8 - 1| = 7
|10 - 13| = 3
Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.

*Note:*


. The number of nodes in the tree is between `2` and `5000`.
. Each node will have value between `0` and `100000`.
