== 1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix

https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/[LeetCode - Shortest Path in Binary Matrix]

In an N by N square grid, each cell is either empty (0) or blocked (1).

A _clear path from top-left to bottom-right_ has length `k` if and only if it is composed of cells `C_1, C_2, ..., C_k` such that:


* Adjacent cells `C_i` and `C_{i+1}` are connected 8-directionally (ie., they are different and share an edge or corner)
* `C_1` is at location `(0, 0)` (ie. has value `grid[0][0]`)
* `C_k` is at location `(N-1, N-1)` (ie. has value `grid[N-1][N-1]`)
* If `C_i` is located at `(r, c)`, then `grid[r][c]` is empty (ie. `grid[r][c] == 0`).


Return the length of the shortest such clear path from top-left to bottom-right.  If such a path does not exist, return -1.

*Note:*


* `1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 100`
* `grid[r][c]` is `0` or `1`
