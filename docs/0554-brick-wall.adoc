= 554. Brick Wall

https://leetcode.com/problems/brick-wall/[LeetCode - Brick Wall]

There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has several rows of bricks. The bricks have the same height but different width. You want to draw a vertical line from the *top* to the *bottom* and cross the *least* bricks.

The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing the width of each brick in this row from left to right.

If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You need to find out how to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number of crossed bricks.

*You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks. *

 

*Example:*

*Input:* [[1,2,2,1],
        [3,1,2],
        [1,3,2],
        [2,4],
        [3,1,2],
        [1,3,1,1]]

*Output:* 2

*Note:*


. The width sum of bricks in different rows are the same and won't exceed INT_MAX.
. The number of bricks in each row is in range [1,10,000]. The height of wall is in range [1,10,000]. Total number of bricks of the wall won't exceed 20,000.
