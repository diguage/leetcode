= 1313. Decompress Run-Length Encoded List

https://leetcode.com/problems/decompress-run-length-encoded-list/[LeetCode - Decompress Run-Length Encoded List^]

We are given a list `nums` of integers representing a list compressed with run-length encoding.

Consider each adjacent pair of elements `[a, b] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]]` (with `i >= 0`).  For each such pair, there are `a` elements with value `b` in the decompressed list.

Return the decompressed list.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* nums = [1,2,3,4]
*Output:* [2,4,4,4]
*Explanation:* The first pair [1,2] means we have freq = 1 and val = 2 so we generate the array [2].
The second pair [3,4] means we have freq = 3 and val = 4 so we generate [4,4,4].
At the end the concatenation [2] + [4,4,4,4] is [2,4,4,4].
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `2 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `nums.length % 2 == 0`
* `<font face="monospace">1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
