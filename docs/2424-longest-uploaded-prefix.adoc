= 2424. Longest Uploaded Prefix

{leetcode}/problems/longest-uploaded-prefix/[LeetCode - 2424. Longest Uploaded Prefix ^]

You are given a stream of `n` videos, each represented by a *distinct* number from `1` to `n` that you need to "upload" to a server. You need to implement a data structure that calculates the length of the *longest uploaded prefix* at various points in the upload process.

We consider `i` to be an uploaded prefix if all videos in the range `1` to `i` (*inclusive*) have been uploaded to the server. The longest uploaded prefix is the *maximum *value of `i` that satisfies this definition.





Implement the `LUPrefix `class:


* `LUPrefix(int n)` Initializes the object for a stream of `n` videos.
* `void upload(int video)` Uploads `video` to the server.
* `int longest()` Returns the length of the *longest uploaded prefix* defined above.


 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input*
["LUPrefix", "upload", "longest", "upload", "longest", "upload", "longest"]
[[4], [3], [], [1], [], [2], []]
*Output*
[null, null, 0, null, 1, null, 3]

*Explanation*
LUPrefix server = new LUPrefix(4);   // Initialize a stream of 4 videos.
server.upload(3);                    // Upload video 3.
server.longest();                    // Since video 1 has not been uploaded yet, there is no prefix.
                                     // So, we return 0.
server.upload(1);                    // Upload video 1.
server.longest();                    // The prefix [1] is the longest uploaded prefix, so we return 1.
server.upload(2);                    // Upload video 2.
server.longest();                    // The prefix [1,2,3] is the longest uploaded prefix, so we return 3.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= video <= n`
* All values of `video` are *distinct*.
* At most `2 * 10^5^` calls *in total* will be made to `upload` and `longest`.
* At least one call will be made to `longest`.
