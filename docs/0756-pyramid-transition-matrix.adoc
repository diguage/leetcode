= 756. Pyramid Transition Matrix

https://leetcode.com/problems/pyramid-transition-matrix/[LeetCode - Pyramid Transition Matrix]

We are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color which is a one letter string.

We are allowed to place any color block `C` on top of two adjacent blocks of colors `A` and `B`, if and only if `ABC` is an allowed triple.

We start with a bottom row of `bottom`, represented as a single string. We also start with a list of allowed triples `allowed`. Each allowed triple is represented as a string of length 3.

Return true if we can build the pyramid all the way to the top, otherwise false.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* bottom = "BCD", allowed = ["BCG", "CDE", "GEA", "FFF"]
*Output:* true
*Explanation:*
We can stack the pyramid like this:
    A
   / \
  G   E
 / \ / \
B   C   D

We are allowed to place G on top of B and C because BCG is an allowed triple.  Similarly, we can place E on top of C and D, then A on top of G and E.

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* bottom = "AABA", allowed = ["AAA", "AAB", "ABA", "ABB", "BAC"]
*Output:* false
*Explanation:*
We can't stack the pyramid to the top.
Note that there could be allowed triples (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) with C != D.

----

 

*Note:*


. `bottom` will be a string with length in range `[2, 8]`.
. `allowed` will have length in range `[0, 200]`.
. Letters in all strings will be chosen from the set `{'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'}`.
