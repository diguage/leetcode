= 1987. Number of Unique Good Subsequences

{leetcode}/problems/number-of-unique-good-subsequences/[LeetCode - 1987. Number of Unique Good Subsequences ^]

You are given a binary string `binary`. A *subsequence* of `binary` is considered *good* if it is *not empty* and has *no leading zeros* (with the exception of `"0"`).

Find the number of *unique good subsequences* of `binary`.


* For example, if `binary = "001"`, then all the *good* subsequences are `["0", "0", "1"]`, so the *unique* good subsequences are `"0"` and `"1"`. Note that subsequences `"00"`, `"01"`, and `"001"` are not good because they have leading zeros.


Return _the number of *unique good subsequences* of _`binary`. Since the answer may be very large, return it *modulo* `10^9^ + 7`.

A *subsequence* is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* binary = "001"
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* The good subsequences of binary are ["0", "0", "1"].
The unique good subsequences are "0" and "1".

----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* binary = "11"
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* The good subsequences of binary are ["1", "1", "11"].
The unique good subsequences are "1" and "11".
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* binary = "101"
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* The good subsequences of binary are ["1", "0", "1", "10", "11", "101"]. 
The unique good subsequences are "0", "1", "10", "11", and "101".

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= binary.length <= 10^5^`
* `binary` consists of only `'0'`s and `'1'`s.
