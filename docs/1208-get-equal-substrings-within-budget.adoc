= 1208. Get Equal Substrings Within Budget

https://leetcode.com/problems/get-equal-substrings-within-budget/[LeetCode - Get Equal Substrings Within Budget^]

You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length. You want to change `s` to `t`. Changing the `i`-th character of `s` to `i`-th character of `t` costs `|s[i] - t[i]|` that is, the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters.

You are also given an integer `maxCost`.

Return the maximum length of a substring of `s` that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t`with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`.

If there is no substring from `s` that can be changed to its corresponding substring from `t`, return `0`.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:*"abc" of s can change to "bcd". That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* Each character in s costs 2 to change to charactor in `t, so the maximum length is 1.`

----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* You can't make any change, so the maximum length is 1.

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5`
* `0 <= maxCost <= 10^6`
* `s` and `t` only contain lower case English letters.
