== 1093. Statistics from a Large Sample

https://leetcode.com/problems/statistics-from-a-large-sample/[LeetCode - Statistics from a Large Sample]

We sampled integers between `0` and `255`, and stored the results in an array `count`:  `count[k]` is the number of integers we sampled equal to `k`.

Return the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and mode of the sample respectively, as an array of *floating point numbers*.  The mode is guaranteed to be unique.

_(Recall that the median of a sample is:_


* _The middle element, if the elements of the sample were sorted and the number of elements is odd;_
* _The average of the middle two elements, if the elements of the sample were sorted and the number of elements is even.)_

*Example 2:*

*Input:* count = [0,4,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

*Constraints:*


* `count.length == 256`
* `1 <= sum(count) <= 10^9`
* The mode of the sample that count represents is unique.
* Answers within `10^-5` of the true value will be accepted as correct.
