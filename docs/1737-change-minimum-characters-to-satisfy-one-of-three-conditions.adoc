= 1737. Change Minimum Characters to Satisfy One of Three Conditions

https://leetcode.com/problems/change-minimum-characters-to-satisfy-one-of-three-conditions/[LeetCode - 1737. Change Minimum Characters to Satisfy One of Three Conditions ^]

You are given two strings `a` and `b` that consist of lowercase letters. In one operation, you can change any character in `a` or `b` to *any lowercase letter*.

Your goal is to satisfy *one* of the following three conditions:


* *Every* letter in `a` is *strictly less* than *every* letter in `b` in the alphabet.
* *Every* letter in `b` is *strictly less* than *every* letter in `a` in the alphabet.
* *Both* `a` and `b` consist of *only one* distinct letter.


Return _the *minimum* number of operations needed to achieve your goal._

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* a = "aba", b = "caa"
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* Consider the best way to make each condition true:
1) Change b to "ccc" in 2 operations, then every letter in a is less than every letter in b.
2) Change a to "bbb" and b to "aaa" in 3 operations, then every letter in b is less than every letter in a.
3) Change a to "aaa" and b to "aaa" in 2 operations, then a and b consist of one distinct letter.
The best way was done in 2 operations (either condition 1 or condition 3).
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* a = "dabadd", b = "cda"
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* The best way is to make condition 1 true by changing b to "eee".
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^5^`
* `a` and `b` consist only of lowercase letters.
