{leetcode}/problems/minimum-operations-to-halve-array-sum/[LeetCode - 2208. Minimum Operations to Halve Array Sum ^]

You are given an array `nums` of positive integers. In one operation, you can choose *any* number from `nums` and reduce it to *exactly* half the number. (Note that you may choose this reduced number in future operations.)

Return_ the *minimum* number of operations to reduce the sum of _`nums`_ by *at least* half._

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [5,19,8,1]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* The initial sum of nums is equal to 5 + 19 + 8 + 1 = 33.
The following is one of the ways to reduce the sum by at least half:
Pick the number 19 and reduce it to 9.5.
Pick the number 9.5 and reduce it to 4.75.
Pick the number 8 and reduce it to 4.
The final array is [5, 4.75, 4, 1] with a total sum of 5 + 4.75 + 4 + 1 = 14.75. 
The sum of nums has been reduced by 33 - 14.75 = 18.25, which is at least half of the initial sum, 18.25 >= 33/2 = 16.5.
Overall, 3 operations were used so we return 3.
It can be shown that we cannot reduce the sum by at least half in less than 3 operations.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [3,8,20]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* The initial sum of nums is equal to 3 + 8 + 20 = 31.
The following is one of the ways to reduce the sum by at least half:
Pick the number 20 and reduce it to 10.
Pick the number 10 and reduce it to 5.
Pick the number 3 and reduce it to 1.5.
The final array is [1.5, 8, 5] with a total sum of 1.5 + 8 + 5 = 14.5. 
The sum of nums has been reduced by 31 - 14.5 = 16.5, which is at least half of the initial sum, 16.5 >= 31/2 = 15.5.
Overall, 3 operations were used so we return 3.
It can be shown that we cannot reduce the sum by at least half in less than 3 operations.

*Constraints:*


* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^7^`
