= 1162. As Far from Land as Possible

https://leetcode.com/problems/as-far-from-land-as-possible/[LeetCode - As Far from Land as Possible]

Given an N x N `grid` containing only values `0` and `1`, where `0` represents water and `1` represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized and return the distance.

The distance used in this problem is the _Manhattan distance_: the distance between two cells `(x0, y0)` and `(x1, y1)` is `|x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|`.

If no land or water exists in the grid, return `-1`.

*Input:* [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:*
The cell (1, 1) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 2.

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:*
The cell (2, 2) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 4.

*Note:*


. `1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 100`
. `grid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`
