= 866. Prime Palindrome

https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-palindrome/[LeetCode - Prime Palindrome^]

Find the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to `N`.

Recall that a number is _prime_ if it's only divisors are 1 and itself, and it is greater than 1. 

For example, 2,3,5,7,11 and 13 are primes.

Recall that a number is a _palindrome_ if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left. 

For example, 12321 is a palindrome.
