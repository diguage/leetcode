{leetcode}/problems/longest-well-performing-interval/[LeetCode - Longest Well-Performing Interval^]

We are given `hours`, a list of the number of hours worked per day for a given employee.

A day is considered to be a _tiring day_ if and only if the number of hours worked is (strictly) greater than `8`.

A _well-performing interval_ is an interval of days for which the number of tiring days is strictly larger than the number of non-tiring days.

Return the length of the longest well-performing interval.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* hours = [9,9,6,0,6,6,9]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* The longest well-performing interval is [9,9,6].

*Constraints:*


* `1 <= hours.length <= 10000`
* `0 <= hours[i] <= 16`
