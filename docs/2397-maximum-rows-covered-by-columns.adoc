= 2397. Maximum Rows Covered by Columns

{leetcode}/problems/maximum-rows-covered-by-columns/[LeetCode - 2397. Maximum Rows Covered by Columns ^]

You are given a *0-indexed* `m x n` binary matrix `matrix` and an integer `numSelect`, which denotes the number of *distinct* columns you must select from `matrix`.

Let us consider `s = {c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, ...., c<sub>numSelect</sub>}` as the set of columns selected by you. A row `row` is *covered* by `s` if:


* For each cell `matrix[row][col]` (`0 <= col <= n - 1`) where `matrix[row][col] == 1`, `col` is present in `s` or,
* *No cell* in `row` has a value of `1`.


You need to choose `numSelect` columns such that the number of rows that are covered is *maximized*.

Return _the *maximum* number of rows that can be *covered* by a set of _`numSelect`_ columns._

*Input:* matrix = [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]], numSelect = 2
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* One possible way to cover 3 rows is shown in the diagram above.
We choose s = {0, 2}.
- Row 0 is covered because it has no occurrences of 1.
- Row 1 is covered because the columns with value 1, i.e. 0 and 2 are present in s.
- Row 2 is not covered because matrix[2][1] == 1 but 1 is not present in s.
- Row 3 is covered because matrix[2][2] == 1 and 2 is present in s.
Thus, we can cover three rows.
Note that s = {1, 2} will also cover 3 rows, but it can be shown that no more than three rows can be covered.

*Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/07/14/rowscovered2.png" style="height: 250px; width: 84px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* matrix = [[1],[0]], numSelect = 1
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* Selecting the only column will result in both rows being covered since the entire matrix is selected.
Therefore, we return 2.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `m == matrix.length`
* `n == matrix[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 12`
* `matrix[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
* `1 <= numSelect <= n`
