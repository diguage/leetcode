== 1218. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence-of-given-difference/[LeetCode - Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference]

Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `<font face="monospace">difference`, return the length of the longest subsequence in <font face="monospace">`arr` which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals `difference`.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.

----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
* `-10^4 <= arr[i], difference <= 10^4`
