= 1254. Number of Closed Islands

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-closed-islands/[LeetCode - Number of Closed Islands^]

Given a 2D `grid` consists of `0s` (land) and `1s` (water).  An _island_ is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of `<font face="monospace">0s` and a _closed island_ is an island *totally* (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by `1s.`

Return the number of _closed islands_.

*Input:* grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* 
Islands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water (group of 1s).
