https://leetcode.com/problems/magic-squares-in-grid/[LeetCode - Magic Squares In Grid^]

A 3 x 3 magic square is a 3 x 3 grid filled with distinct numbers *from 1 to 9* such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have the same sum.

Given an `grid` of integers, how many 3 x 3 "magic square" subgrids are there?  (Each subgrid is contiguous).

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [[4,3,8,4],
        [9,5,1,9],
        [2,7,6,2]]
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:*
The following subgrid is a 3 x 3 magic square:
438
951
276

while this one is not:
384
519
762

In total, there is only one magic square inside the given grid.

*Note:*


. `1 <= grid.length <= 10`
. `1 <= grid[0].length <= 10`
. `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 15`
