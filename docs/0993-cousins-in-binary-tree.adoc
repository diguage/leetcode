= 993. Cousins in Binary Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/cousins-in-binary-tree/[LeetCode - Cousins in Binary Tree]

In a binary tree, the root node is at depth `0`, and children of each depth `k` node are at depth `k+1`.

Two nodes of a binary tree are _cousins_ if they have the same depth, but have *different parents*.

We are given the `root` of a binary tree with unique values, and the values `x` and `y` of two different nodes in the tree.

Return `true` if and only if the nodes corresponding to the values `x` and `y` are cousins.

 

*Example 1:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* root = [1,2,3,4], x = 4, y = 3
*Output:* false
----


*Example 2:


image::https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/12/q1248-02.png[{image_attr}]*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* root = [1,2,3,null,4,null,5], x = 5, y = 4
*Output:* true
----


*Example 3:*

image::https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/13/q1248-03.png[{image_attr}]

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* root = [1,2,3,null,4], x = 2, y = 3
*Output:* false
----

 



*Note:*


. The number of nodes in the tree will be between `2` and `100`.
. Each node has a unique integer value from `1` to `100`.
