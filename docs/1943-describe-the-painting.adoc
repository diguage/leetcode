{leetcode}/problems/describe-the-painting/[LeetCode - 1943. Describe the Painting ^]

There is a long and thin painting that can be represented by a number line. The painting was painted with multiple overlapping segments where each segment was painted with a *unique* color. You are given a 2D integer array `segments`, where `segments[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>, color<sub>i</sub>]` represents the *half-closed segment* `[start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>)` with `color<sub>i</sub>` as the color.

The colors in the overlapping segments of the painting were *mixed* when it was painted. When two or more colors mix, they form a new color that can be represented as a *set* of mixed colors.


* For example, if colors `2`, `4`, and `6` are mixed, then the resulting mixed color is `{2,4,6}`.


For the sake of simplicity, you should only output the *sum* of the elements in the set rather than the full set.

You want to *describe* the painting with the *minimum* number of non-overlapping *half-closed segments* of these mixed colors. These segments can be represented by the 2D array `painting` where `painting[j] = [left<sub>j</sub>, right<sub>j</sub>, mix<sub>j</sub>]` describes a *half-closed segment* `[left<sub>j</sub>, right<sub>j</sub>)` with the mixed color *sum* of `mix<sub>j</sub>`.


* For example, the painting created with `segments = [[1,4,5],[1,7,7]]` can be described by `painting = [[1,4,12],[4,7,7]]` because:

	
	* `[1,4)` is colored `{5,7}` (with a sum of `12`) from both the first and second segments.
	* `[4,7)` is colored `{7}` from only the second segment.
	
	


Return _the 2D array _`painting`_ describing the finished painting (excluding any parts that are *not *painted). You may return the segments in *any order*_.

A *half-closed segment* `[a, b)` is the section of the number line between points `a` and `b` *including* point `a` and *not including* point `b`.

*Input:* segments = [[1,4,5],[4,7,7],[1,7,9]]
*Output:* [[1,4,14],[4,7,16]]
*Explanation: *The painting can be described as follows:
- [1,4) is colored {5,9} (with a sum of 14) from the first and third segments.
- [4,7) is colored {7,9} (with a sum of 16) from the second and third segments.
----

*Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/18/2.png" style="width: 532px; height: 219px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* segments = [[1,7,9],[6,8,15],[8,10,7]]
*Output:* [[1,6,9],[6,7,24],[7,8,15],[8,10,7]]
*Explanation: *The painting can be described as follows:
- [1,6) is colored 9 from the first segment.
- [6,7) is colored {9,15} (with a sum of 24) from the first and second segments.
- [7,8) is colored 15 from the second segment.
- [8,10) is colored 7 from the third segment.
----

*Example 3:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/04/c1.png" style="width: 529px; height: 289px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* segments = [[1,4,5],[1,4,7],[4,7,1],[4,7,11]]
*Output:* [[1,4,12],[4,7,12]]
*Explanation: *The painting can be described as follows:
- [1,4) is colored {5,7} (with a sum of 12) from the first and second segments.
- [4,7) is colored {1,11} (with a sum of 12) from the third and fourth segments.
Note that returning a single segment [1,7) is incorrect because the mixed color sets are different.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= segments.length <= 2 * 10^4^`
* `segments[i].length == 3`
* `1 <= start<sub>i</sub> < end<sub>i</sub> <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= color<sub>i</sub> <= 10^9^`
* Each `color<sub>i</sub>` is distinct.
