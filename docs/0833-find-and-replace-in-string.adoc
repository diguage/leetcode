= 833. Find And Replace in String

{leetcode}/problems/find-and-replace-in-string/[LeetCode - Find And Replace in String^]

To some string `S`, we will perform some replacement operations that replace groups of letters with new ones (not necessarily the same size).

Each replacement operation has `3` parameters: a starting index `i`, a source word `x` and a target word `y`.  The rule is that if `<font face="monospace">x` starts at position `i` in the *original* *string* *`S`*, then we will replace that occurrence of `x` with `y`.  If not, we do nothing.

For example, if we have `S = "abcd"` and we have some replacement operation `i = 2, x = "cd", y = "ffff"`, then because `"cd"` starts at position `<font face="monospace">2` in the original string `S`, we will replace it with `"ffff"`.

Using another example on `S = "abcd"`, if we have both the replacement operation `i = 0, x = "ab", y = "eee"`, as well as another replacement operation `i = 2, x = "ec", y = "ffff"`, this second operation does nothing because in the original string `S[2] = 'c'`, which doesn't match `x[0] = 'e'`.

All these operations occur simultaneously.  It's guaranteed that there won't be any overlap in replacement: for example, `S = "abc", indexes = [0, 1], sources = ["ab","bc"]` is not a valid test case.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* S = "abcd", indexes = [0,2], sources = ["a","cd"], targets = ["eee","ffff"]
*Output:* "eeebffff"
*Explanation:* "a" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by "eee".
"cd" starts at index 2 in S, so it's replaced by "ffff".
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* S = "abcd", indexes = [0,2], sources = ["ab","ec"], targets = ["eee","ffff"]
*Output:* "eeecd"
*Explanation:* "ab" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by "eee". 
"ec" doesn't starts at index 2 in the *original* S, so we do nothing.
----

Notes:


. `0 <= indexes.length = sources.length = targets.length <= 100`
. `0 < indexes[i] < S.length <= 1000`
. All characters in given inputs are lowercase letters.
