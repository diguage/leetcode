= 2042. Check if Numbers Are Ascending in a Sentence

https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-numbers-are-ascending-in-a-sentence/[LeetCode - 2042. Check if Numbers Are Ascending in a Sentence ^]

A sentence is a list of *tokens* separated by a *single* space with no leading or trailing spaces. Every token is either a *positive number* consisting of digits `0-9` with no leading zeros, or a *word* consisting of lowercase English letters.


* For example, `"a puppy has 2 eyes 4 legs"` is a sentence with seven tokens: `"2"` and `"4"` are numbers and the other tokens such as `"puppy"` are words.


Given a string `s` representing a sentence, you need to check if *all* the numbers in `s` are *strictly increasing* from left to right (i.e., other than the last number, *each* number is *strictly smaller* than the number on its *right* in `s`).

Return `true`_ if so, or _`false`_ otherwise_.

----
*Input:* s = "1 box has 3 blue 4 red 6 green and 12 yellow marbles"
*Output:* true
*Explanation:* The numbers in s are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 12.
They are strictly increasing from left to right: 1 < 3 < 4 < 6 < 12.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "hello world 5 x 5"
*Output:* false
*Explanation:* The numbers in s are: [.underline]#*5*#, *[.underline]#5#*. They are not strictly increasing.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*
<img alt="example-3" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/30/example3.png" style="width: 794px; height: 48px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "sunset is at 7 51 pm overnight lows will be in the low 50 and 60 s"
*Output:* false
*Explanation:* The numbers in s are: 7, [.underline]#*51*#, [.underline]#*50*#, 60. They are not strictly increasing.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `3 <= s.length <= 200`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters, spaces, and digits from `0` to `9`, inclusive.
* The number of tokens in `s` is between `2` and `100`, inclusive.
* The tokens in `s` are separated by a single space.
* There are at least *two* numbers in `s`.
* Each number in `s` is a *positive* number *less* than `100`, with no leading zeros.
* `s` contains no leading or trailing spaces.
