= 2500. Delete Greatest Value in Each Row

{leetcode}/problems/delete-greatest-value-in-each-row/[LeetCode - 2500. Delete Greatest Value in Each Row ^]

You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of positive integers.

Perform the following operation until `grid` becomes empty:


* Delete the element with the greatest value from each row. If multiple such elements exist, delete any of them.
* Add the maximum of deleted elements to the answer.


*Note* that the number of columns decreases by one after each operation.

Return _the answer after performing the operations described above_.

*Input:* grid = [[1,2,4],[3,3,1]]
*Output:* 8
*Explanation:* The diagram above shows the removed values in each step.
- In the first operation, we remove 4 from the first row and 3 from the second row (notice that, there are two cells with value 3 and we can remove any of them). We add 4 to the answer.
- In the second operation, we remove 2 from the first row and 3 from the second row. We add 3 to the answer.
- In the third operation, we remove 1 from the first row and 1 from the second row. We add 1 to the answer.
The final answer = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8.

*Example 2:*

*Input:* grid = [[10]]
*Output:* 10
*Explanation:* The diagram above shows the removed values in each step.
- In the first operation, we remove 10 from the first row. We add 10 to the answer.
The final answer = 10.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 50`
* `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
