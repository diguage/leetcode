https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz-multithreaded/[LeetCode - Fizz Buzz Multithreaded]

Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to _n_, however:


* If the number is divisible by 3, output "fizz".
* If the number is divisible by 5, output "buzz".
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, output "fizzbuzz".


For example, for `n = 15`, we output: `1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz`.

Suppose you are given the following code:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
class FizzBuzz {
  public FizzBuzz(int n) { ... }               // constructor
  public void fizz(printFizz) { ... }          // only output "fizz"
  public void buzz(printBuzz) { ... }          // only output "buzz"
  public void fizzbuzz(printFizzBuzz) { ... }  // only output "fizzbuzz"
  public void number(printNumber) { ... }      // only output the numbers
}
----

Implement a multithreaded version of `FizzBuzz` with *four* threads. The same instance of `FizzBuzz` will be passed to four different threads:


* Thread A will call `fizz()` to check for divisibility of 3 and outputs `fizz`.
* Thread B will call `buzz()` to check for divisibility of 5 and outputs `buzz`.
* Thread C will call `fizzbuzz()` to check for divisibility of 3 and 5 and outputs `fizzbuzz`.
* Thread D will call `number()` which should only output the numbers.
