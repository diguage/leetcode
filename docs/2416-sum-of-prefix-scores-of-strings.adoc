= 2416. Sum of Prefix Scores of Strings

{leetcode}/problems/sum-of-prefix-scores-of-strings/[LeetCode - 2416. Sum of Prefix Scores of Strings ^]

You are given an array `words` of size `n` consisting of *non-empty* strings.

We define the *score* of a string `word` as the *number* of strings `words[i]` such that `word` is a *prefix* of `words[i]`.


* For example, if `words = ["a", "ab", "abc", "cab"]`, then the score of `"ab"` is `2`, since `"ab"` is a prefix of both `"ab"` and `"abc"`.


Return _an array _`answer`_ of size _`n`_ where _`answer[i]`_ is the *sum* of scores of every *non-empty* prefix of _`words[i]`.

*Note* that a string is considered as a prefix of itself.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* words = ["abc","ab","bc","b"]
*Output:* [5,4,3,2]
*Explanation:* The answer for each string is the following:
- "abc" has 3 prefixes: "a", "ab", and "abc".
- There are 2 strings with the prefix "a", 2 strings with the prefix "ab", and 1 string with the prefix "abc".
The total is answer[0] = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.
- "ab" has 2 prefixes: "a" and "ab".
- There are 2 strings with the prefix "a", and 2 strings with the prefix "ab".
The total is answer[1] = 2 + 2 = 4.
- "bc" has 2 prefixes: "b" and "bc".
- There are 2 strings with the prefix "b", and 1 string with the prefix "bc".
The total is answer[2] = 2 + 1 = 3.
- "b" has 1 prefix: "b".
- There are 2 strings with the prefix "b".
The total is answer[3] = 2.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* words = ["abcd"]
*Output:* [4]
*Explanation:*
"abcd" has 4 prefixes: "a", "ab", "abc", and "abcd".
Each prefix has a score of one, so the total is answer[0] = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 1000`
* `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
