== 951. Flip Equivalent Binary Trees

https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-equivalent-binary-trees/[LeetCode - Flip Equivalent Binary Trees]

For a binary tree T, we can define a flip operation as follows: choose any node, and swap the left and right child subtrees.

A binary tree X is _flip equivalent_ to a binary tree Y if and only if we can make X equal to Y after some number of flip operations.

Write a function that determines whether two binary trees are _flip equivalent_.  The trees are given by root nodes `root1` and `root2`.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *root1 = <span id="example-input-1-1">[1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8], root2 = <span id="example-input-1-2">[1,3,2,null,6,4,5,null,null,null,null,8,7]
*Output: *<span id="example-output-1">true
*Explanation: *We flipped at nodes with values 1, 3, and 5.

*Note:*


. Each tree will have at most `100` nodes.
. Each value in each tree will be a unique integer in the range `[0, 99]`.
