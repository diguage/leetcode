= 2187. Minimum Time to Complete Trips

{leetcode}/problems/minimum-time-to-complete-trips/[LeetCode - 2187. Minimum Time to Complete Trips ^]

You are given an array `time` where `time[i]` denotes the time taken by the `i^th^` bus to complete *one trip*.

Each bus can make multiple trips *successively*; that is, the next trip can start *immediately after* completing the current trip. Also, each bus operates *independently*; that is, the trips of one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus.

You are also given an integer `totalTrips`, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make *in total*. Return _the *minimum time* required for all buses to complete *at least* _`totalTrips`_ trips_.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* time = [1,2,3], totalTrips = 5
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:*
- At time t = 1, the number of trips completed by each bus are [1,0,0]. 
  The total number of trips completed is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
- At time t = 2, the number of trips completed by each bus are [2,1,0]. 
  The total number of trips completed is 2 + 1 + 0 = 3.
- At time t = 3, the number of trips completed by each bus are [3,1,1]. 
  The total number of trips completed is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.
So the minimum time needed for all buses to complete at least 5 trips is 3.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* time = [2], totalTrips = 1
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:*
There is only one bus, and it will complete its first trip at t = 2.
So the minimum time needed to complete 1 trip is 2.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= time.length <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= time[i], totalTrips <= 10^7^`
