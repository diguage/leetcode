= 1751. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II

{leetcode}/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended-ii/[LeetCode - 1751. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II ^]

You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDay<sub>i</sub>, endDay<sub>i</sub>, value<sub>i</sub>]`. The `i^th^` event starts at `startDay<sub>i</sub>`<sub> </sub>and ends at `endDay<sub>i</sub>`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `value<sub>i</sub>`. You are also given an integer `k` which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.

You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the *entire* event. Note that the end day is *inclusive*: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day.

Return _the *maximum sum* of values that you can receive by attending events._

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,1]], k = 2
*Output:* 7
*Explanation: *Choose the green events, 0 and 1 (0-indexed) for a total value of 4 + 3 = 7.
----

*Example 2:*

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/10/screenshot-2021-01-11-at-60150-pm.png" style="width: 400px; height: 103px;" />

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,10]], k = 2
*Output:* 10
*Explanation:* Choose event 2 for a total value of 10.
Notice that you cannot attend any other event as they overlap, and that you do *not* have to attend k events.
----

*Example 3:*

*<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/10/screenshot-2021-01-11-at-60703-pm.png" style="width: 400px; height: 126px;" />*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* events = [[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3],[4,4,4]], k = 3
*Output:* 9
*Explanation:* Although the events do not overlap, you can only attend 3 events. Pick the highest valued three.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= k <= events.length`
* `1 <= k * events.length <= 10^6^`
* `1 <= startDay<sub>i</sub> <= endDay<sub>i</sub> <= 10^9^`
* `1 <= value<sub>i</sub> <= 10^6^`
