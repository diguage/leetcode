https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/[LeetCode - Intersection of Two Arrays II]

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
*Output:* [2,2]
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
*Output:* [4,9]
----


*Note:*


* Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
* The result can be in any order.


*Follow up:*


* What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
* What if _nums1_'s size is small compared to _nums2_'s size? Which algorithm is better?
* What if elements of _nums2_ are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
