== 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/[LeetCode - Reverse Nodes in k-Group]

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list _k_ at a time and return its modified list.

_k_ is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of _k_ then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.




*Example:*

Given this linked list: `1->2->3->4->5`

For _k_ = 2, you should return: `2->1->4->3->5`

For _k_ = 3, you should return: `3->2->1->4->5`

*Note:*


* Only constant extra memory is allowed.
* You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
