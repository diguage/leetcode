{leetcode}/problems/sum-of-nodes-with-even-valued-grandparent/[LeetCode - Sum of Nodes with Even-Valued Grandparent^]

Given a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with even-valued grandparent.  (A _grandparent_ of a node is the parent of its parent, if it exists.)

If there are no nodes with an even-valued grandparent, return `0`.
