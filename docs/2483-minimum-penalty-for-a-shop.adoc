= 2483. Minimum Penalty for a Shop

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-penalty-for-a-shop/[LeetCode - 2483. Minimum Penalty for a Shop ^]

You are given the customer visit log of a shop represented by a *0-indexed* string `customers` consisting only of characters `'N'` and `'Y'`:


* if the `i^th^` character is `'Y'`, it means that customers come at the `i^th^` hour
* whereas `'N'` indicates that no customers come at the `i^th^` hour.


If the shop closes at the `j^th^` hour (`0 <= j <= n`), the *penalty* is calculated as follows:


* For every hour when the shop is open and no customers come, the penalty increases by `1`.
* For every hour when the shop is closed and customers come, the penalty increases by `1`.


Return_ the *earliest* hour at which the shop must be closed to incur a *minimum* penalty._

*Note* that if a shop closes at the `j^th^` hour, it means the shop is closed at the hour `j`.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* customers = "YYNY"
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* 
- Closing the shop at the 0^th^ hour incurs in 1+1+0+1 = 3 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 1^st^ hour incurs in 0+1+0+1 = 2 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 2^nd^ hour incurs in 0+0+0+1 = 1 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 3^rd^ hour incurs in 0+0+1+1 = 2 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 4^th^ hour incurs in 0+0+1+0 = 1 penalty.
Closing the shop at 2^nd^ or 4^th^ hour gives a minimum penalty. Since 2 is earlier, the optimal closing time is 2.

----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* customers = "NNNNN"
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* It is best to close the shop at the 0^th^ hour as no customers arrive.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* customers = "YYYY"
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* It is best to close the shop at the 4^th^ hour as customers arrive at each hour.

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= customers.length <= 10^5^`
* `customers` consists only of characters `'Y'` and `'N'`.
