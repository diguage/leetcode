= 2070. Most Beautiful Item for Each Query

{leetcode}/problems/most-beautiful-item-for-each-query/[LeetCode - 2070. Most Beautiful Item for Each Query ^]

You are given a 2D integer array `items` where `items[i] = [price<sub>i</sub>, beauty<sub>i</sub>]` denotes the *price* and *beauty* of an item respectively.

You are also given a *0-indexed* integer array `queries`. For each `queries[j]`, you want to determine the *maximum beauty* of an item whose *price* is *less than or equal* to `queries[j]`. If no such item exists, then the answer to this query is `0`.

Return _an array _`answer`_ of the same length as _`queries`_ where _`answer[j]`_ is the answer to the _`j^th^`_ query_.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* items = [[1,2],[3,2],[2,4],[5,6],[3,5]], queries = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
*Output:* [2,4,5,5,6,6]
*Explanation:*
- For queries[0]=1, [1,2] is the only item which has price <= 1. Hence, the answer for this query is 2.
- For queries[1]=2, the items which can be considered are [1,2] and [2,4]. 
  The maximum beauty among them is 4.
- For queries[2]=3 and queries[3]=4, the items which can be considered are [1,2], [3,2], [2,4], and [3,5].
  The maximum beauty among them is 5.
- For queries[4]=5 and queries[5]=6, all items can be considered.
  Hence, the answer for them is the maximum beauty of all items, i.e., 6.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* items = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4]], queries = [1]
*Output:* [4]
*Explanation:* 
The price of every item is equal to 1, so we choose the item with the maximum beauty 4. 
Note that multiple items can have the same price and/or beauty.  
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* items = [[10,1000]], queries = [5]
*Output:* [0]
*Explanation:*
No item has a price less than or equal to 5, so no item can be chosen.
Hence, the answer to the query is 0.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= items.length, queries.length <= 10^5^`
* `items[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= price<sub>i</sub>, beauty<sub>i</sub>, queries[j] <= 10^9^`
