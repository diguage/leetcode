{leetcode}/problems/online-election/[LeetCode - Online Election^]

In an election, the `i`-th vote was cast for `persons[i]` at time `times[i]`.

Now, we would like to implement the following query function: `TopVotedCandidate.q(int t)` will return the number of the person that was leading the election at time `t`.  

Votes cast at time `t` will count towards our query.  In the case of a tie, the most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.

 


*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* ["TopVotedCandidate","q","q","q","q","q","q"], [[[0,1,1,0,0,1,0],[0,5,10,15,20,25,30]],[3],[12],[25],[15],[24],[8]]
*Output:* [null,0,1,1,0,0,1]
*Explanation:*
At time 3, the votes are [0], and 0 is leading.
At time 12, the votes are [0,1,1], and 1 is leading.
At time 25, the votes are [0,1,1,0,0,1], and 1 is leading (as ties go to the most recent vote.)
This continues for 3 more queries at time 15, 24, and 8.

*Note:*


. `1 <= persons.length = times.length <= 5000`
. `0 <= persons[i] <= persons.length`
. `times` is a strictly increasing array with all elements in `[0, 10^9]`.
. `TopVotedCandidate.q` is called at most `10000` times per test case.
. `TopVotedCandidate.q(int t)` is always called with `t >= times[0]`.
