= 995. Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-k-consecutive-bit-flips/[LeetCode - Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips]

In an array `A` containing only 0s and 1s, a _`K`-bit flip _consists of choosing a (contiguous) subarray of length `K` and simultaneously changing every 0 in the subarray to 1, and every 1 in the subarray to 0.

Return the minimum number of `K`-bit flips required so that there is no 0 in the array.  If it is not possible, return `-1`.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* A = [0,1,0], K = 1
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* Flip A[0], then flip A[2].
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* A = [1,1,0], K = 2
*Output:* -1
*Explanation:* No matter how we flip subarrays of size 2, we can't make the array become [1,1,1].
----


*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* A = [0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0], K = 3
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:*
Flip A[0],A[1],A[2]: A becomes [1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0]
Flip A[4],A[5],A[6]: A becomes [1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]
Flip A[5],A[6],A[7]: A becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
----

 



*Note:*


. `1 <= A.length <= 30000`
. `1 <= K <= A.length`
