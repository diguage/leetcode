= 2398. Maximum Number of Robots Within Budget

{leetcode}/problems/maximum-number-of-robots-within-budget/[LeetCode - 2398. Maximum Number of Robots Within Budget ^]

You have `n` robots. You are given two *0-indexed* integer arrays, `chargeTimes` and `runningCosts`, both of length `n`. The `i^th^` robot costs `chargeTimes[i]` units to charge and costs `runningCosts[i]` units to run. You are also given an integer `budget`.

The *total cost* of running `k` chosen robots is equal to `max(chargeTimes) + k * sum(runningCosts)`, where `max(chargeTimes)` is the largest charge cost among the `k` robots and `sum(runningCosts)` is the sum of running costs among the `k` robots.

Return_ the *maximum* number of *consecutive* robots you can run such that the total cost *does not* exceed _`budget`.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* chargeTimes = [3,6,1,3,4], runningCosts = [2,1,3,4,5], budget = 25
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* 
It is possible to run all individual and consecutive pairs of robots within budget.
To obtain answer 3, consider the first 3 robots. The total cost will be max(3,6,1) + 3 * sum(2,1,3) = 6 + 3 * 6 = 24 which is less than 25.
It can be shown that it is not possible to run more than 3 consecutive robots within budget, so we return 3.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* chargeTimes = [11,12,19], runningCosts = [10,8,7], budget = 19
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* No robot can be run that does not exceed the budget, so we return 0.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `chargeTimes.length == runningCosts.length == n`
* `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4^`
* `1 <= chargeTimes[i], runningCosts[i] <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= budget <= 10^15^`
