= 1000. Minimum Cost to Merge Stones

{leetcode}/problems/minimum-cost-to-merge-stones/[LeetCode - Minimum Cost to Merge Stones^]

There are `N` piles of stones arranged in a row.  The `i`-th pile has `stones[i]` stones.

A _move_ consists of merging *exactly `K` consecutive* piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these `K` piles.

Find the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile.  If it is impossible, return `-1`.

 


*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 2
*Output:* 20
*Explanation:*
We start with [3, 2, 4, 1].
We merge [3, 2] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 4, 1].
We merge [4, 1] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 5].
We merge [5, 5] for a cost of 10, and we are left with [10].
The total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 3
*Output:* -1
*Explanation:* After any merge operation, there are 2 piles left, and we can't merge anymore.  So the task is impossible.
----


*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* stones = [3,5,1,2,6], K = 3
*Output:* 25
*Explanation:*
We start with [3, 5, 1, 2, 6].
We merge [5, 1, 2] for a cost of 8, and we are left with [3, 8, 6].
We merge [3, 8, 6] for a cost of 17, and we are left with [17].
The total cost was 25, and this is the minimum possible.
----

 

*Note:*


* `1 <= stones.length <= 30`
* `2 <= K <= 30`
* `1 <= stones[i] <= 100`
