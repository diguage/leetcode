= 1161. Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-level-sum-of-a-binary-tree/[LeetCode - Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree]

Given the `root` of a binary tree, the level of its root is `1`, the level of its children is `2`, and so on.

Return the *smallest* level `X` such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level `X` is *maximal*.

 

*Example 1:*

----
*Input:* [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:*
Level 1 sum = 1.
Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.
Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.
So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.

*Note:*


. The number of nodes in the given tree is between `1` and `10^4`.
. `-10^5 <= node.val <= 10^5`
