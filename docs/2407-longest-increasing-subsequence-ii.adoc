https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence-ii/[LeetCode - 2407. Longest Increasing Subsequence II ^]

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

Find the longest subsequence of `nums` that meets the following requirements:


* The subsequence is *strictly increasing* and
* The difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence is *at most* `k`.


Return_ the length of the *longest* *subsequence* that meets the requirements._

A *subsequence* is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [4,2,1,4,3,4,5,8,15], k = 3
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:*
The longest subsequence that meets the requirements is [1,3,4,5,8].
The subsequence has a length of 5, so we return 5.
Note that the subsequence [1,3,4,5,8,15] does not meet the requirements because 15 - 8 = 7 is larger than 3.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [7,4,5,1,8,12,4,7], k = 5
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:*
The longest subsequence that meets the requirements is [4,5,8,12].
The subsequence has a length of 4, so we return 4.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [1,5], k = 1
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:*
The longest subsequence that meets the requirements is [1].
The subsequence has a length of 1, so we return 1.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= nums[i], k <= 10^5^`
