= 2512. Reward Top K Students

https://leetcode.com/problems/reward-top-k-students/[LeetCode - 2512. Reward Top K Students ^]

You are given two string arrays `positive_feedback` and `negative_feedback`, containing the words denoting positive and negative feedback, respectively. Note that *no* word is both positive and negative.

Initially every student has `0` points. Each positive word in a feedback report *increases* the points of a student by `3`, whereas each negative word *decreases* the points by `1`.

You are given `n` feedback reports, represented by a *0-indexed* string array `report` and a *0-indexed* integer array `student_id`, where `student_id[i]` represents the ID of the student who has received the feedback report `report[i]`. The ID of each student is *unique*.

Given an integer `k`, return _the top _`k`_ students after ranking them in *non-increasing* order by their points_. In case more than one student has the same points, the one with the lower ID ranks higher.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* positive_feedback = ["smart","brilliant","studious"], negative_feedback = ["not"], report = ["this student is studious","the student is smart"], student_id = [1,2], k = 2
*Output:* [1,2]
*Explanation:* 
Both the students have 1 positive feedback and 3 points but since student 1 has a lower ID he ranks higher.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* positive_feedback = ["smart","brilliant","studious"], negative_feedback = ["not"], report = ["this student is not studious","the student is smart"], student_id = [1,2], k = 2
*Output:* [2,1]
*Explanation:* 
- The student with ID 1 has 1 positive feedback and 1 negative feedback, so he has 3-1=2 points. 
- The student with ID 2 has 1 positive feedback, so he has 3 points. 
Since student 2 has more points, [2,1] is returned.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= positive_feedback.length, negative_feedback.length <= 10^4^`
* `1 <= positive_feedback[i].length, negative_feedback[j].length <= 100`
* Both `positive_feedback[i]` and `negative_feedback[j]` consists of lowercase English letters.
* No word is present in both `positive_feedback` and `negative_feedback`.
* `n == report.length == student_id.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^4^`
* `report[i]` consists of lowercase English letters and spaces `' '`.
* There is a single space between consecutive words of `report[i]`.
* `1 <= report[i].length <= 100`
* `1 <= student_id[i] <= 10^9^`
* All the values of `student_id[i]` are *unique*.
* `1 <= k <= n`
