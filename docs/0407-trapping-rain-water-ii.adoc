= 407. Trapping Rain Water II

https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water-ii/[LeetCode - Trapping Rain Water II]

Given an `m x n` matrix of positive integers representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, compute the volume of water it is able to trap after raining.

 

*Note:*

Both _m_ and _n_ are less than 110. The height of each unit cell is greater than 0 and is less than 20,000.

 

*Example:*

Given the following 3x6 height map:
[
  [1,4,3,1,3,2],
  [3,2,1,3,2,4],
  [2,3,3,2,3,1]
]

Return 4.
