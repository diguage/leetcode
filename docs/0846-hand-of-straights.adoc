https://leetcode.com/problems/hand-of-straights/[LeetCode - Hand of Straights]

Alice has a `hand` of cards, given as an array of integers.

Now she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is size `W`, and consists of `W` consecutive cards.

Return `true` if and only if she can.

 




*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], W = 3
*Output:* true
*Explanation:* Alice's `hand` can be rearranged as `[1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]`.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* hand = [1,2,3,4,5], W = 4
*Output:* false
*Explanation:* Alice's `hand` can't be rearranged into groups of `4`.
----

 

*Note:*


. `1 <= hand.length <= 10000`
. `0 <= hand[i] <= 10^9`
. `1 <= W <= hand.length`
