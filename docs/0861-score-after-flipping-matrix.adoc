= 861. Score After Flipping Matrix

https://leetcode.com/problems/score-after-flipping-matrix/[LeetCode - Score After Flipping Matrix]

We have a two dimensional matrix `A` where each value is `0` or `1`.

A move consists of choosing any row or column, and toggling each value in that row or column: changing all `0`s to `1`s, and all `1`s to `0`s.

After making any number of moves, every row of this matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the score of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.

Return the highest possible score.

 





*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,0]]
*Output:* 39
*Explanation:*
Toggled to [[1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]].
0b1111 + 0b1001 + 0b1111 = 15 + 9 + 15 = 39
----

 

*Note:*


. `1 <= A.length <= 20`
. `1 <= A[0].length <= 20`
. `A[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
