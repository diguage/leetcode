Given two binary trees `original` and `cloned` and given a reference to a node `target` in the original tree.

The `cloned` tree is a *copy of* the `original` tree.

Return _a reference to the same node_ in the `cloned` tree.

*Note* that you are *not allowed* to change any of the two trees or the `target` node and the answer *must be* a reference to a node in the `cloned` tree.

 
*Example 1:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/21/e1.png" style="width: 544px; height: 426px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* tree = [7,4,3,null,null,6,19], target = 3
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* In all examples the original and cloned trees are shown. The target node is a green node from the original tree. The answer is the yellow node from the cloned tree.
----

*Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/21/e2.png" style="width: 221px; height: 159px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* tree = [7], target =  7
*Output:* 7
----

*Example 3:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/21/e3.png" style="width: 459px; height: 486px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* tree = [8,null,6,null,5,null,4,null,3,null,2,null,1], target = 4
*Output:* 4
----

 
*Constraints:*


* The number of nodes in the `tree` is in the range `[1, 10^4^]`.
* The values of the nodes of the `tree` are unique.
* `target` node is a node from the `original` tree and is not `null`.


 
*Follow up:* Could you solve the problem if repeated values on the tree are allowed?
