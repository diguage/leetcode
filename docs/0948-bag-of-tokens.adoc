= 948. Bag of Tokens

https://leetcode.com/problems/bag-of-tokens/[LeetCode - Bag of Tokens]

You have an initial power `P`, an initial score of `0` points, and a bag of tokens.

Each token can be used at most once, has a value `token[i]`, and has potentially two ways to use it.


* If we have at least `token[i]` power, we may play the token face up, losing `token[i]` power, and gaining `1` point.
* If we have at least `1` point, we may play the token face down, gaining `token[i]` power, and losing `1` point.


Return the largest number of points we can have after playing any number of tokens.

 





*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* tokens = [100], P = 50
*Output:* 0
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* tokens = [100,200], P = 150
*Output:* 1
----


*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* tokens = [100,200,300,400], P = 200
*Output:* 2
----

 

*Note:*


* `tokens.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= tokens[i] < 10000`
* `0 <= P < 10000`
