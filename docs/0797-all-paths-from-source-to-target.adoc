= 797. All Paths From Source to Target

https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-to-target/[LeetCode - All Paths From Source to Target^]

Given a directed, acyclic graph of `N` nodes.  Find all possible paths from node `0` to node `N-1`, and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows:  the nodes are 0, 1, ..., graph.length - 1.  graph[i] is a list of all nodes j for which the edge (i, j) exists.

*Example:*
*Input:* [[1,2], [3], [3], []] 
*Output:* [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]] 
*Explanation:* The graph looks like this:
0--->1
|    |
v    v
2--->3
There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.
----

*Note:*


* The number of nodes in the graph will be in the range `[2, 15]`.
* You can print different paths in any order, but you should keep the order of nodes inside one path.
