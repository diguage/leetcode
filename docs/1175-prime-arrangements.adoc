Return the number of permutations of 1 to `n` so that prime numbers are at prime indices (1-indexed.)

_(Recall that an integer is prime if and only if it is greater than 1, and cannot be written as a product of two positive integers both smaller than it.)_

Since the answer may be large, return the answer *modulo `10^9 + 7`*.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 5
*Output:* 12
*Explanation:* For example [1,2,5,4,3] is a valid permutation, but [5,2,3,4,1] is not because the prime number 5 is at index 1.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 100
*Output:* 682289015
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 100`
