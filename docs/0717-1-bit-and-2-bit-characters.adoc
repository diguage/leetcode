= 717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters

{leetcode}/problems/1-bit-and-2-bit-characters/[LeetCode - 1-bit and 2-bit Characters^]

We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit `0`. The second character can be represented by two bits (`10` or `11`).  

Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.

*Example 1:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* 
bits = [1, 0, 0]
*Output:* True
*Explanation:* 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.
----


*Example 2:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* 
bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
*Output:* False
*Explanation:* 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.
----


*Note:*
. `1 <= len(bits) <= 1000`.</li>
. `bits[i]` is always `0` or `1`.</li>
