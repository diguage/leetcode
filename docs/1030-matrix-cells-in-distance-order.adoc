= 1030. Matrix Cells in Distance Order

{leetcode}/problems/matrix-cells-in-distance-order/[LeetCode - Matrix Cells in Distance Order^]

We are given a matrix with `R` rows and `C` columns has cells with integer coordinates `(r, c)`, where `0 <= r < R` and `0 <= c < C`.

Additionally, we are given a cell in that matrix with coordinates `(r0, c0)`.

Return the coordinates of all cells in the matrix, sorted by their distance from `(r0, c0)` from smallest distance to largest distance.  Here, the distance between two cells `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` is the Manhattan distance, `|r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|`.  (You may return the answer in any order that satisfies this condition.)

 


*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* R = 1, C = 2, r0 = 0, c0 = 0
*Output:* [[0,0],[0,1]]
*Explanation:* The distances from (r0, c0) to other cells are: [0,1]
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* R = 2, C = 2, r0 = 0, c0 = 1
*Output:* [[0,1],[0,0],[1,1],[1,0]]
*Explanation:* The distances from (r0, c0) to other cells are: [0,1,1,2]
The answer [[0,1],[1,1],[0,0],[1,0]] would also be accepted as correct.
----


*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* R = 2, C = 3, r0 = 1, c0 = 2
*Output:* [[1,2],[0,2],[1,1],[0,1],[1,0],[0,0]]
*Explanation:* The distances from (r0, c0) to other cells are: [0,1,1,2,2,3]
There are other answers that would also be accepted as correct, such as [[1,2],[1,1],[0,2],[1,0],[0,1],[0,0]].

*Note:*


. `1 <= R <= 100`
. `1 <= C <= 100`
. `0 <= r0 < R`
. `0 <= c0 < C`
