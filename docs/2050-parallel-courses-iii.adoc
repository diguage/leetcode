https://leetcode.com/problems/parallel-courses-iii/[LeetCode - 2050. Parallel Courses III ^]

You are given an integer `n`, which indicates that there are `n` courses labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given a 2D integer array `relations` where `relations[j] = [prevCourse<sub>j</sub>, nextCourse<sub>j</sub>]` denotes that course `prevCourse<sub>j</sub>` has to be completed *before* course `nextCourse<sub>j</sub>` (prerequisite relationship). Furthermore, you are given a *0-indexed* integer array `time` where `time[i]` denotes how many *months* it takes to complete the `(i+1)^th^` course.

You must find the *minimum* number of months needed to complete all the courses following these rules:


* You may start taking a course at *any time* if the prerequisites are met.
* *Any number of courses* can be taken at the *same time*.


Return _the *minimum* number of months needed to complete all the courses_.

*Note:* The test cases are generated such that it is possible to complete every course (i.e., the graph is a directed acyclic graph).

*Input:* n = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]], time = [3,2,5]
*Output:* 8
*Explanation:* The figure above represents the given graph and the time required to complete each course. 
We start course 1 and course 2 simultaneously at month 0.
Course 1 takes 3 months and course 2 takes 2 months to complete respectively.
Thus, the earliest time we can start course 3 is at month 3, and the total time required is 3 + 5 = 8 months.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
*<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/07/ex2.png" style="width: 500px; height: 365px;" />*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 5, relations = [[1,5],[2,5],[3,5],[3,4],[4,5]], time = [1,2,3,4,5]
*Output:* 12
*Explanation:* The figure above represents the given graph and the time required to complete each course.
You can start courses 1, 2, and 3 at month 0.
You can complete them after 1, 2, and 3 months respectively.
Course 4 can be taken only after course 3 is completed, i.e., after 3 months. It is completed after 3 + 4 = 7 months.
Course 5 can be taken only after courses 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been completed, i.e., after max(1,2,3,7) = 7 months.
Thus, the minimum time needed to complete all the courses is 7 + 5 = 12 months.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4^`
* `0 <= relations.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 5 * 10^4^)`
* `relations[j].length == 2`
* `1 <= prevCourse<sub>j</sub>, nextCourse<sub>j</sub> <= n`
* `prevCourse<sub>j</sub> != nextCourse<sub>j</sub>`
* All the pairs `[prevCourse<sub>j</sub>, nextCourse<sub>j</sub>]` are *unique*.
* `time.length == n`
* `1 <= time[i] <= 10^4^`
* The given graph is a directed acyclic graph.
