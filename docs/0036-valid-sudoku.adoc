* Each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character `'.'`.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*
[
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
*Output:* true
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*
[
  ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
*Output:* false
*Explanation:* Same as Example 1, except with the *5* in the top left corner being 
    modified to *8*. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
----

*Note:*


* A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
* Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
* The given board contain only digits `1-9` and the character `'.'`.
* The given board size is always `9x9`.
