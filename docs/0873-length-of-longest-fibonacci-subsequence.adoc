= 873. Length of Longest Fibonacci Subsequence

{leetcode}/problems/length-of-longest-fibonacci-subsequence/[LeetCode - Length of Longest Fibonacci Subsequence^]

A sequence `X_1, X_2, ..., X_n` is _fibonacci-like_ if:


* `n >= 3`
* `X_i + X_{i+1} = X_{i+2}` for all `i + 2 <= n`


Given a *strictly increasing* array `A` of positive integers forming a sequence, find the *length* of the longest fibonacci-like subsequence of `A`.  If one does not exist, return 0.

(_Recall that a subsequence is derived from another sequence `A` by deleting any number of elements (including none) from `A`, without changing the order of the remaining elements.  For example, `[3, 5, 8]` is a subsequence of `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`._)

 




*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:
*The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,2,3,5,8].
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [1,3,7,11,12,14,18]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation*:
The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like:
[1,11,12], [3,11,14] or [7,11,18].
----

 

*Note:*


* `3 <= A.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= A[0] < A[1] < ... < A[A.length - 1] <= 10^9`
* _(The time limit has been reduced by 50% for submissions in Java, C, and C++.)_
