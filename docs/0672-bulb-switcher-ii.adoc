There is a room with `n` lights which are turned on initially and 4 buttons on the wall. After performing exactly `m` unknown operations towards buttons, you need to return how many different kinds of status of the `n` lights could be.

Suppose `n` lights are labeled as number [1, 2, 3 ..., n], function of these 4 buttons are given below:


. Flip all the lights.
. Flip lights with even numbers.
. Flip lights with odd numbers.
. Flip lights with (3k + 1) numbers, k = 0, 1, 2, ...
