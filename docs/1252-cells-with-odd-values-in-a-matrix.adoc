= 1252. Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix

{leetcode}/problems/cells-with-odd-values-in-a-matrix/[LeetCode - Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix^]

Given `n` and `m` which are the dimensions of a matrix initialized by zeros and given an array `indices` where `indices[i] = [ri, ci]`. For each pair of `[ri, ci]` you have to increment all cells in row `ri` and column `ci` by 1.

Return _the number of cells with odd values_ in the matrix after applying the increment to all `indices`.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 2, m = 3, indices = [[0,1],[1,1]]
*Output:* 6
*Explanation:* Initial matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]].
After applying first increment it becomes [[1,2,1],[0,1,0]].
The final matrix will be [[1,3,1],[1,3,1]] which contains 6 odd numbers.

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 2, m = 2, indices = [[1,1],[0,0]]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* Final matrix = [[2,2],[2,2]]. There is no odd number in the final matrix.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 50`
* `1 <= m <= 50`
* `1 <= indices.length <= 100`
* `0 <= indices[i][0] < n`
* `0 <= indices[i][1] < m`
