= 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/[LeetCode - Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array]

Given a sorted array _nums_, remove the duplicates https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm[*in-place*] such that each element appear only _once_ and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by *modifying the input array https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm[in-place]* with O(1) extra memory.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
Given _nums_ = *[1,1,2]*,

Your function should return length = *`2`*, with the first two elements of _`nums`_ being *`1`* and *`2`* respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
Given _nums_ = *[0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]*,

Your function should return length = *`5`*, with the first five elements of _`nums`_ being modified to *`0`*, *`1`*, *`2`*, *`3`*, and *`4`* respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

----

*Clarification:*

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by *reference*, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
// *nums* is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to *nums* in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first *len* elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
