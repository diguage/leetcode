== 1092. Shortest Common Supersequence 

https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-common-supersequence/[LeetCode - Shortest Common Supersequence ]

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return the shortest string that has both `str1` and `str2` as subsequences.  If multiple answers exist, you may return any of them.

_(A string S is a subsequence of string T if deleting some number of characters from T (possibly 0, and the characters are chosen [.underline]#anywhere# from T) results in the string S.)_

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* str1 = "abac", str2 = "cab"
*Output:* "cabac"
*Explanation:*
str1 = "abac" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the first "c".
str2 = "cab" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the last "ac".
The answer provided is the shortest such string that satisfies these properties.
----

 

*Note:*


. `1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000`
. `str1` and `str2` consist of lowercase English letters.
