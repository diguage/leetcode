= 430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List

https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/[LeetCode - Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List^]

You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
*Output:* [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]
*Explanation:
*
The multilevel linked list in the input is as follows:

After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* head = [1,2,null,3]
*Output:* [1,3,2]
*Explanation:

*The input multilevel linked list is as follows:

  1---2---NULL
  |
  3---NULL

----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* head = []
*Output:* []

----

 

*How multilevel linked list is represented in test case:*

We use the multilevel linked list from *Example 1* above:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL
----

The serialization of each level is as follows:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]

----

To serialize all levels together we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[null,null,7,8,9,10,null]
[null,11,12,null]

----

Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
----

 
*Constraints:*


* Number of Nodes will not exceed 1000.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
