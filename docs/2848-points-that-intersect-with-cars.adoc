= 2848. Points That Intersect With Cars

https://leetcode.com/problems/points-that-intersect-with-cars/[LeetCode - 2848. Points That Intersect With Cars ^]

You are given a *0-indexed* 2D integer array `nums` representing the coordinates of the cars parking on a number line. For any index `i`, `nums[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]` where `start<sub>i</sub>` is the starting point of the `i^th^` car and `end<sub>i</sub>` is the ending point of the `i^th^` car.

Return _the number of integer points on the line that are covered with *any part* of a car._

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [[3,6],[1,5],[4,7]]
*Output:* 7
*Explanation:* All the points from 1 to 7 intersect at least one car, therefore the answer would be 7.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [[1,3],[5,8]]
*Output:* 7
*Explanation:* Points intersecting at least one car are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8. There are a total of 7 points, therefore the answer would be 7.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `nums[i].length == 2`
* `<font face="monospace">1 <= start<sub>i</sub> <= end<sub>i</sub> <= 100`
