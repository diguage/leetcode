https://leetcode.com/problems/take-gifts-from-the-richest-pile/[LeetCode - 2558. Take Gifts From the Richest Pile ^]

You are given an integer array `gifts` denoting the number of gifts in various piles. Every second, you do the following:


* Choose the pile with the maximum number of gifts.
* If there is more than one pile with the maximum number of gifts, choose any.
* Leave behind the floor of the square root of the number of gifts in the pile. Take the rest of the gifts.


Return _the number of gifts remaining after _`k`_ seconds._

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* gifts = [25,64,9,4,100], k = 4
*Output:* 29
*Explanation:* 
The gifts are taken in the following way:
- In the first second, the last pile is chosen and 10 gifts are left behind.
- Then the second pile is chosen and 8 gifts are left behind.
- After that the first pile is chosen and 5 gifts are left behind.
- Finally, the last pile is chosen again and 3 gifts are left behind.
The final remaining gifts are [5,8,9,4,3], so the total number of gifts remaining is 29.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* gifts = [1,1,1,1], k = 4
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* 
In this case, regardless which pile you choose, you have to leave behind 1 gift in each pile. 
That is, you can't take any pile with you. 
So, the total gifts remaining are 4.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= gifts.length <= 10^3^`
* `1 <= gifts[i] <= 10^9^`
* `1 <= k <= 10^3^`
