== 1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves

https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves/[LeetCode - Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves]

Given a rooted binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.

Recall that:


* The node of a binary tree is a _leaf_ if and only if it has no children
* The _depth_ of the root of the tree is 0, and if the depth of a node is `d`, the depth of each of its children is `d+1`.
* The _lowest common ancestor_ of a set `S` of nodes is the node `A` with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root `A`.


 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* root = [1,2,3]
*Output:* [1,2,3]
*Explanation:* 
The deepest leaves are the nodes with values 2 and 3.
The lowest common ancestor of these leaves is the node with value 1.
The answer returned is a TreeNode object (not an array) with serialization "[1,2,3]".
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* root = [1,2,3,4]
*Output:* [4]
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* root = [1,2,3,4,5]
*Output:* [2,4,5]
----

 
*Constraints:*


* The given tree will have between 1 and 1000 nodes.
* Each node of the tree will have a distinct value between 1 and 1000.
