= 1621. Number of Sets of K Non-Overlapping Line Segments

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-sets-of-k-non-overlapping-line-segments/[LeetCode - 1621. Number of Sets of K Non-Overlapping Line Segments ^]

Given `n` points on a 1-D plane, where the `i^th^` point (from `0` to `n-1`) is at `x = i`, find the number of ways we can draw *exactly* `k` *non-overlapping* line segments such that each segment covers two or more points. The endpoints of each segment must have *integral coordinates*. The `k` line segments *do not* have to cover all `n` points, and they are *allowed* to share endpoints.

Return _the number of ways we can draw _`k`_ non-overlapping line segments__._ Since this number can be huge, return it *modulo* `10^9^ + 7`.

*Input:* n = 4, k = 2
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* The two line segments are shown in red and blue.
The image above shows the 5 different ways {(0,2),(2,3)}, {(0,1),(1,3)}, {(0,1),(2,3)}, {(1,2),(2,3)}, {(0,1),(1,2)}.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 3, k = 1
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* The 3 ways are {(0,1)}, {(0,2)}, {(1,2)}.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 30, k = 7
*Output:* 796297179
*Explanation:* The total number of possible ways to draw 7 line segments is 3796297200. Taking this number modulo 10^9^ + 7 gives us 796297179.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `2 <= n <= 1000`
* `1 <= k <= n-1`
