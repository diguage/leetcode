= 1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest

{leetcode}/problems/delete-nodes-and-return-forest/[LeetCode - Delete Nodes And Return Forest^]

Given the `root` of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.

After deleting all nodes with a value in `to_delete`, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).

Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest.  You may return the result in any order.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
*Output:* [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
----

 
*Constraints:*


* The number of nodes in the given tree is at most `1000`.
* Each node has a distinct value between `1` and `1000`.
* `to_delete.length <= 1000`
* `to_delete` contains distinct values between `1` and `1000`.

== 思路分析

利用递归，在“后序遍历”阶段，对当前阶段判断是否需要删除。
