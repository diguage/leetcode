{leetcode}/problems/rings-and-rods/[LeetCode - 2103. Rings and Rods ^]

There are `n` rings and each ring is either red, green, or blue. The rings are distributed *across ten rods* labeled from `0` to `9`.

You are given a string `rings` of length `2n` that describes the `n` rings that are placed onto the rods. Every two characters in `rings` forms a *color-position pair* that is used to describe each ring where:


* The *first* character of the `i^th^` pair denotes the `i^th^` ring's *color* (`'R'`, `'G'`, `'B'`).
* The *second* character of the `i^th^` pair denotes the *rod* that the `i^th^` ring is placed on (`'0'` to `'9'`).


For example, `"R3G2B1"` describes `n == 3` rings: a red ring placed onto the rod labeled 3, a green ring placed onto the rod labeled 2, and a blue ring placed onto the rod labeled 1.

Return _the number of rods that have *all three colors* of rings on them._

 
*Example 1:*

*Input:* rings = "B0B6G0R6R0R6G9"
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* 
- The rod labeled 0 holds 3 rings with all colors: red, green, and blue.
- The rod labeled 6 holds 3 rings, but it only has red and blue.
- The rod labeled 9 holds only a green ring.
Thus, the number of rods with all three colors is 1.
----

*Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/23/ex2final.png" style="width: 266px; height: 130px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* rings = "B0R0G0R9R0B0G0"
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* 
- The rod labeled 0 holds 6 rings with all colors: red, green, and blue.
- The rod labeled 9 holds only a red ring.
Thus, the number of rods with all three colors is 1.
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* rings = "G4"
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* 
Only one ring is given. Thus, no rods have all three colors.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `rings.length == 2 * n`
* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `rings[i]` where `i` is *even* is either `'R'`, `'G'`, or `'B'` (*0-indexed*).
* `rings[i]` where `i` is *odd* is a digit from `'0'` to `'9'` (*0-indexed*).
