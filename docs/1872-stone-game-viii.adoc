Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with *Alice starting first*.

There are `n` stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, while the number of stones is *more than one*, they will do the following:


* Choose an integer `x > 1`, and *remove* the leftmost `x` stones from the row.
* Add the *sum* of the *removed* stones' values to the player's score.
* Place a *new stone*, whose value is equal to that sum, on the left side of the row.


The game stops when *only* *one* stone is left in the row.

The *score difference* between Alice and Bob is `(Alice's score - Bob's score)`. Alice's goal is to *maximize* the score difference, and Bob's goal is the *minimize* the score difference.

Given an integer array `stones` of length `n` where `stones[i]` represents the value of the `i^th^` stone *from the left*, return _the *score difference* between Alice and Bob if they both play *optimally*._

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* stones = [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:*
- Alice removes the first 4 stones, adds (-1) + 2 + (-3) + 4 = 2 to her score, and places a stone of
  value 2 on the left. stones = [2,-5].
- Bob removes the first 2 stones, adds 2 + (-5) = -3 to his score, and places a stone of value -3 on
  the left. stones = [-3].
The difference between their scores is 2 - (-3) = 5.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* stones = [7,-6,5,10,5,-2,-6]
*Output:* 13
*Explanation:*
- Alice removes all stones, adds 7 + (-6) + 5 + 10 + 5 + (-2) + (-6) = 13 to her score, and places a
  stone of value 13 on the left. stones = [13].
The difference between their scores is 13 - 0 = 13.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* stones = [-10,-12]
*Output:* -22
*Explanation:*
- Alice can only make one move, which is to remove both stones. She adds (-10) + (-12) = -22 to her
  score and places a stone of value -22 on the left. stones = [-22].
The difference between their scores is (-22) - 0 = -22.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == stones.length`
* `2 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `-10^4^ <= stones[i] <= 10^4^`
