= 2014. Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times

{leetcode}/problems/longest-subsequence-repeated-k-times/[LeetCode - 2014. Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times ^]

You are given a string `s` of length `n`, and an integer `k`. You are tasked to find the *longest subsequence repeated* `k` times in string `s`.

A *subsequence* is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

A subsequence `seq` is *repeated* `k` times in the string `s` if `seq * k` is a subsequence of `s`, where `seq * k` represents a string constructed by concatenating `seq` `k` times.


* For example, `"bba"` is repeated `2` times in the string `"bababcba"`, because the string `"bbabba"`, constructed by concatenating `"bba"` `2` times, is a subsequence of the string `"*[.underline]#b#*a*[.underline]#bab#*c*[.underline]#ba#*"`.


Return _the *longest subsequence repeated* _`k`_ times in string _`s`_. If multiple such subsequences are found, return the *lexicographically largest* one. If there is no such subsequence, return an *empty* string_.

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "letsleetcode", k = 2
*Output:* "let"
*Explanation:* There are two longest subsequences repeated 2 times: "let" and "ete".
"let" is the lexicographically largest one.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "bb", k = 2
*Output:* "b"
*Explanation:* The longest subsequence repeated 2 times is "b".
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "ab", k = 2
*Output:* ""
*Explanation:* There is no subsequence repeated 2 times. Empty string is returned.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == s.length`
* `2 <= n, k <= 2000`
* `2 <= n < k * 8`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
