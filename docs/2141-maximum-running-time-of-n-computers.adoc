= 2141. Maximum Running Time of N Computers

{leetcode}/problems/maximum-running-time-of-n-computers/[LeetCode - 2141. Maximum Running Time of N Computers ^]

You have `n` computers. You are given the integer `n` and a *0-indexed* integer array `batteries` where the `i^th^` battery can *run* a computer for `batteries[i]` minutes. You are interested in running *all* `n` computers *simultaneously* using the given batteries.

Initially, you can insert *at most one battery* into each computer. After that and at any integer time moment, you can remove a battery from a computer and insert another battery *any number of times*. The inserted battery can be a totally new battery or a battery from another computer. You may assume that the removing and inserting processes take no time.

Note that the batteries cannot be recharged.

Return _the *maximum* number of minutes you can run all the _`n`_ computers simultaneously._

*Input:* n = 2, batteries = [3,3,3]
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* 
Initially, insert battery 0 into the first computer and battery 1 into the second computer.
After two minutes, remove battery 1 from the second computer and insert battery 2 instead. Note that battery 1 can still run for one minute.
At the end of the third minute, battery 0 is drained, and you need to remove it from the first computer and insert battery 1 instead.
By the end of the fourth minute, battery 1 is also drained, and the first computer is no longer running.
We can run the two computers simultaneously for at most 4 minutes, so we return 4.

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 2, batteries = [1,1,1,1]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* 
Initially, insert battery 0 into the first computer and battery 2 into the second computer. 
After one minute, battery 0 and battery 2 are drained so you need to remove them and insert battery 1 into the first computer and battery 3 into the second computer. 
After another minute, battery 1 and battery 3 are also drained so the first and second computers are no longer running.
We can run the two computers simultaneously for at most 2 minutes, so we return 2.

*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= batteries.length <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= batteries[i] <= 10^9^`
