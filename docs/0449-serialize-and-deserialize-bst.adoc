{leetcode}/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-bst/[LeetCode - Serialize and Deserialize BST^]

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a *binary search tree*. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

*The encoded string should be as compact as possible.*

*Note:* Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
