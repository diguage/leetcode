= 2304. Minimum Path Cost in a Grid

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-cost-in-a-grid/[LeetCode - 2304. Minimum Path Cost in a Grid ^]

You are given a *0-indexed* `m x n` integer matrix `grid` consisting of *distinct* integers from `0` to `m * n - 1`. You can move in this matrix from a cell to any other cell in the *next* row. That is, if you are in cell `(x, y)` such that `x < m - 1`, you can move to any of the cells `(x + 1, 0)`, `(x + 1, 1)`, ..., `(x + 1, n - 1)`. *Note* that it is not possible to move from cells in the last row.

Each possible move has a cost given by a *0-indexed* 2D array `moveCost` of size `(m * n) x n`, where `moveCost[i][j]` is the cost of moving from a cell with value `i` to a cell in column `j` of the next row. The cost of moving from cells in the last row of `grid` can be ignored.

The cost of a path in `grid` is the *sum* of all values of cells visited plus the *sum* of costs of all the moves made. Return _the *minimum* cost of a path that starts from any cell in the *first* row and ends at any cell in the *last* row._

*Input:* grid = [[5,3],[4,0],[2,1]], moveCost = [[9,8],[1,5],[10,12],[18,6],[2,4],[14,3]]
*Output:* 17
*Explanation: *The path with the minimum possible cost is the path 5 -> 0 -> 1.
- The sum of the values of cells visited is 5 + 0 + 1 = 6.
- The cost of moving from 5 to 0 is 3.
- The cost of moving from 0 to 1 is 8.
So the total cost of the path is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* grid = [[5,1,2],[4,0,3]], moveCost = [[12,10,15],[20,23,8],[21,7,1],[8,1,13],[9,10,25],[5,3,2]]
*Output:* 6
*Explanation:* The path with the minimum possible cost is the path 2 -> 3.
- The sum of the values of cells visited is 2 + 3 = 5.
- The cost of moving from 2 to 3 is 1.
So the total cost of this path is 5 + 1 = 6.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `2 <= m, n <= 50`
* `grid` consists of distinct integers from `0` to `m * n - 1`.
* `moveCost.length == m * n`
* `moveCost[i].length == n`
* `1 <= moveCost[i][j] <= 100`
