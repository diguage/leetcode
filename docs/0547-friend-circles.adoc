== 547. Friend Circles

https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-circles/[LeetCode - Friend Circles]


There are *N* students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a *direct* friend of B, and B is a *direct* friend of C, then A is an *indirect* friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.



Given a *N*N* matrix *M* representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the i~th~ and j~th~ students are *direct* friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.


*Example 1:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:*The 0~th~ and 1~st~ students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. <br/>The 2~nd~ student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.
----


*Example 2:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,1],
 [0,1,1]]
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:*The 0~th~ and 1~st~ students are direct friends, the 1~st~ and 2~nd~ students are direct friends, <br/>so the 0~th~ and 2~nd~ students are indirect friends. All of them are in the same friend circle, so return 1.

*Note:*<br>

. N is in range [1,200].
. M[i][i] = 1 for all students.
. If M[i][j] = 1, then M[j][i] = 1.
