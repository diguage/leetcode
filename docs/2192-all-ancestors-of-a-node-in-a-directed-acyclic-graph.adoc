= 2192. All Ancestors of a Node in a Directed Acyclic Graph

https://leetcode.com/problems/all-ancestors-of-a-node-in-a-directed-acyclic-graph/[LeetCode - 2192. All Ancestors of a Node in a Directed Acyclic Graph ^]

You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes of a *Directed Acyclic Graph* (DAG). The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1` (*inclusive*).

You are also given a 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>]` denotes that there is a *unidirectional* edge from `from<sub>i</sub>` to `to<sub>i</sub>` in the graph.

Return _a list_ `answer`_, where _`answer[i]`_ is the *list of ancestors* of the_ `i^th^` _node, sorted in *ascending order*_.

A node `u` is an *ancestor* of another node `v` if `u` can reach `v` via a set of edges.

*Input:* n = 8, edgeList = [[0,3],[0,4],[1,3],[2,4],[2,7],[3,5],[3,6],[3,7],[4,6]]
*Output:* [[],[],[],[0,1],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,2,3]]
*Explanation:*
The above diagram represents the input graph.
- Nodes 0, 1, and 2 do not have any ancestors.
- Node 3 has two ancestors 0 and 1.
- Node 4 has two ancestors 0 and 2.
- Node 5 has three ancestors 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 6 has five ancestors 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 7 has four ancestors 0, 1, 2, and 3.

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 5, edgeList = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
*Output:* [[],[0],[0,1],[0,1,2],[0,1,2,3]]
*Explanation:*
The above diagram represents the input graph.
- Node 0 does not have any ancestor.
- Node 1 has one ancestor 0.
- Node 2 has two ancestors 0 and 1.
- Node 3 has three ancestors 0, 1, and 2.
- Node 4 has four ancestors 0, 1, 2, and 3.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 1000`
* `0 <= edges.length <= min(2000, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub> <= n - 1`
* `from<sub>i</sub> != to<sub>i</sub>`
* There are no duplicate edges.
* The graph is *directed* and *acyclic*.
