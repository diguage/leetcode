= 75. Sort Colors

https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/[LeetCode - Sort Colors]

Given an array with _n_ objects colored red, white or blue, sort them *https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm[in-place] *so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

*Note:* You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

*Example:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [2,0,2,1,1,0]
*Output:* [0,0,1,1,2,2]
----

*Follow up:*


* A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.


	First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
* Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?
