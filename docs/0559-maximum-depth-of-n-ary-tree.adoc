= 559. Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-n-ary-tree/[LeetCode - Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree]

Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

_Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)._
