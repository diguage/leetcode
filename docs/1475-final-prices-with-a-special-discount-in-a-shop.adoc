{leetcode}/problems/final-prices-with-a-special-discount-in-a-shop/[LeetCode - 1475. Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop ^]

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of the `i^th^` item in a shop.

There is a special discount for items in the shop. If you buy the `i^th^` item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to `prices[j]` where `j` is the minimum index such that `j > i` and `prices[j] <= prices[i]`. Otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

Return an integer array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the final price you will pay for the `i^th^` item of the shop, considering the special discount.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
*Output:* [4,2,4,2,3]
*Explanation:* 
For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4.
For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2.
For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4.
For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
*Output:* [1,2,3,4,5]
*Explanation:* In this case, for all items, you will not receive any discount at all.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* prices = [10,1,1,6]
*Output:* [9,0,1,6]
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= prices.length <= 500`
* `1 <= prices[i] <= 1000`
