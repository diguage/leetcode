https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-meals/[LeetCode - 1711. Count Good Meals ^]

A *good meal* is a meal that contains *exactly two different food items* with a sum of deliciousness equal to a power of two.

You can pick *any* two different foods to make a good meal.

Given an array of integers `deliciousness` where `deliciousness[i]` is the deliciousness of the `i^​​​​​​th^​​​​`​​​​ item of food, return _the number of different *good meals* you can make from this list modulo_ `10^9^ + 7`.

Note that items with different indices are considered different even if they have the same deliciousness value.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* deliciousness = [1,3,5,7,9]
*Output:* 4
*Explanation: *The good meals are (1,3), (1,7), (3,5) and, (7,9).
Their respective sums are 4, 8, 8, and 16, all of which are powers of 2.

----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* deliciousness = [1,1,1,3,3,3,7]
*Output:* 15
*Explanation: *The good meals are (1,1) with 3 ways, (1,3) with 9 ways, and (1,7) with 3 ways.

*Constraints:*


* `1 <= deliciousness.length <= 10^5^`
* `0 <= deliciousness[i] <= 2^20^`
