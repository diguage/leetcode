https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/[LeetCode - Simplify Path]

Given an *absolute path* for a file (Unix-style), simplify it. Or in other words, convert it to the **canonical path**.

In a UNIX-style file system, a period . refers to the current directory. Furthermore, a double period .. moves the directory up a level. For more information, see: https://www.linuxnix.com/abslute-path-vs-relative-path-in-linuxunix/[Absolute path vs relative path in Linux/Unix].

Note that the returned canonical path must always begin with a slash `/`, and there must be only a single slash `/` between two directory names. The last directory name (if it exists) *must not* end with a trailing `/`. Also, the canonical path must be the *shortest* string representing the absolute path.

.Example 1:
----
Input: "/home/"
Output: "/home"
Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.
----

.Example 2:
----
Input: "/../"
Output: "/"
Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.
----

.Example 3:
----
Input: "/home//foo/"
Output: "/home/foo"
Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.
----

.Example 4:
----
Input: "/a/./b/../../c/"
Output: "/c"
----

.Example 5:
----
Input: "/a/../../b/../c//.//"
Output: "/c"
----

.Example 6:
----
Input: "/a//b////c/d//././/.."
Output: "/a/b/c"
----

== 解题分析

有点想复杂了，只需要一个字符串分割，然后加一个辅助栈即可。

不过，我感觉滑动窗口应该也可以，回头可以试试。
