= 48. Rotate Image

https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/[LeetCode - Rotate Image]

You are given an _n_ x _n_ 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

*Note:*

You have to rotate the image https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm[*in-place*], which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. *DO NOT* allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
Given *input matrix* = 
[
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
],

rotate the input matrix *in-place* such that it becomes:
[
  [7,4,1],
  [8,5,2],
  [9,6,3]
]
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
Given *input matrix* =
[
  [ 5, 1, 9,11],
  [ 2, 4, 8,10],
  [13, 3, 6, 7],
  [15,14,12,16]
], 

rotate the input matrix *in-place* such that it becomes:
[
  [15,13, 2, 5],
  [14, 3, 4, 1],
  [12, 6, 8, 9],
  [16, 7,10,11]
]
