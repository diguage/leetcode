You are given a *0-indexed* integer array `forts` of length `n` representing the positions of several forts. `forts[i]` can be `-1`, `0`, or `1` where:


* `-1` represents there is *no fort* at the `i^th^` position.
* `0` indicates there is an *enemy* fort at the `i^th^` position.
* `1` indicates the fort at the `i^th^` the position is under your command.


Now you have decided to move your army from one of your forts at position `i` to an empty position `j` such that:


* `0 <= i, j <= n - 1`
* The army travels over enemy forts *only*. Formally, for all `k` where `min(i,j) < k < max(i,j)`, `forts[k] == 0.`


While moving the army, all the enemy forts that come in the way are *captured*.

Return_ the *maximum* number of enemy forts that can be captured_. In case it is *impossible* to move your army, or you do not have any fort under your command, return `0`_._

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* forts = [1,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,1]
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:*
- Moving the army from position 0 to position 3 captures 2 enemy forts, at 1 and 2.
- Moving the army from position 8 to position 3 captures 4 enemy forts.
Since 4 is the maximum number of enemy forts that can be captured, we return 4.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* forts = [0,0,1,-1]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* Since no enemy fort can be captured, 0 is returned.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= forts.length <= 1000`
* `-1 <= forts[i] <= 1`
