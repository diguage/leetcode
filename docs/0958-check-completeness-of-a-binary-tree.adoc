Given a binary tree, determine if it is a _complete binary tree_.

[.underline]#*Definition of a complete binary tree from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees[Wikipedia^]:*#


In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2^h^ nodes inclusive at the last level h.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [1,2,3,4,5,6]
*Output:* true
*Explanation:* Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
*Output:* false
*Explanation:* The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.
----

 


*Note:*


. The tree will have between 1 and 100 nodes.
