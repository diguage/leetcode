= 2246. Longest Path With Different Adjacent Characters

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-path-with-different-adjacent-characters/[LeetCode - 2246. Longest Path With Different Adjacent Characters ^]

You are given a *tree* (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) *rooted* at node `0` consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The tree is represented by a *0-indexed* array `parent` of size `n`, where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node `0` is the root, `parent[0] == -1`.

You are also given a string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i]` is the character assigned to node `i`.

Return _the length of the *longest path* in the tree such that no pair of *adjacent* nodes on the path have the same character assigned to them._

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/25/testingdrawio.png" style="width: 201px; height: 241px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* parent = [-1,0,0,1,1,2], s = "abacbe"
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters in the tree is the path: 0 -> 1 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned.
It can be proven that there is no longer path that satisfies the conditions.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/25/graph2drawio.png" style="width: 201px; height: 221px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* parent = [-1,0,0,0], s = "aabc"
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters is the path: 2 -> 0 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == parent.length == s.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `0 <= parent[i] <= n - 1` for all `i >= 1`
* `parent[0] == -1`
* `parent` represents a valid tree.
* `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
