= 1238. Circular Permutation in Binary Representation

https://leetcode.com/problems/circular-permutation-in-binary-representation/[LeetCode - Circular Permutation in Binary Representation]

Given 2 integers `n` and `start`. Your task is return *any* permutation `p` of `(0,1,2.....,2^n -1) `such that :


* `p[0] = start`
* `p[i]` and `p[i+1]` differ by only one bit in their binary representation.
* `p[0]` and `p[2^n -1]` must also differ by only one bit in their binary representation.


 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 2, start = 3
*Output:* [3,2,0,1]
*Explanation:* The binary representation of the permutation is (11,10,00,01). 
All the adjacent element differ by one bit. Another valid permutation is [3,1,0,2]
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 3, start = 2
*Output:* [2,6,7,5,4,0,1,3]
*Explanation:* The binary representation of the permutation is (010,110,111,101,100,000,001,011).
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 16`
* `0 <= start < 2 ^ n`
