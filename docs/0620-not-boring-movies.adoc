https://leetcode.com/problems/not-boring-movies/[LeetCode - Not Boring Movies]

X city opened a new cinema, many people would like to go to this cinema. The cinema also gives out a poster indicating the movies&rsquo; ratings and descriptions.
Please write a SQL query to output movies with an odd numbered ID and a description that is not 'boring'. Order the result by rating.

 

For example, table `cinema`:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
|   2     | Science   |   fiction    |   8.5     |
|   3     | irish     |   boring     |   6.2     |
|   4     | Ice song  |   Fantacy    |   8.6     |
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
----
For the example above, the output should be:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
