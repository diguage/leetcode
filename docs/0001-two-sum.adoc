= 1. Two Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/[LeetCode - Two Sum]

Given an array of integers, return *indices* of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have *_exactly_* one solution, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

.Example:
[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[*0*] + nums[*1*] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [*0*, *1*].
