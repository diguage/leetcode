= 2126. Destroying Asteroids

https://leetcode.com/problems/destroying-asteroids/[LeetCode - 2126. Destroying Asteroids ^]

You are given an integer `mass`, which represents the original mass of a planet. You are further given an integer array `asteroids`, where `asteroids[i]` is the mass of the `i^th^` asteroid.

You can arrange for the planet to collide with the asteroids in *any arbitrary order*. If the mass of the planet is *greater than or equal to* the mass of the asteroid, the asteroid is *destroyed* and the planet *gains* the mass of the asteroid. Otherwise, the planet is destroyed.

Return `true`_ if *all* asteroids can be destroyed. Otherwise, return _`false`_._

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* mass = 10, asteroids = [3,9,19,5,21]
*Output:* true
*Explanation:* One way to order the asteroids is [9,19,5,3,21]:
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 9. New planet mass: 10 + 9 = 19
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 19. New planet mass: 19 + 19 = 38
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 5. New planet mass: 38 + 5 = 43
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 3. New planet mass: 43 + 3 = 46
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 21. New planet mass: 46 + 21 = 67
All asteroids are destroyed.

----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* mass = 5, asteroids = [4,9,23,4]
*Output:* false
*Explanation:* 
The planet cannot ever gain enough mass to destroy the asteroid with a mass of 23.
After the planet destroys the other asteroids, it will have a mass of 5 + 4 + 9 + 4 = 22.
This is less than 23, so a collision would not destroy the last asteroid.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= mass <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= asteroids.length <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= asteroids[i] <= 10^5^`
