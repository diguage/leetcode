= 996. Number of Squareful Arrays

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-squareful-arrays/[LeetCode - Number of Squareful Arrays^]

Given an array `A` of non-negative integers, the array is _squareful_ if for every pair of adjacent elements, their sum is a perfect square.

Return the number of permutations of A that are squareful.  Two permutations `A1` and `A2` differ if and only if there is some index `i` such that `A1[i] != A2[i]`.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [1,17,8]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:*
[1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [2,2,2]
*Output:* 1
----

 

*Note:*


. `1 <= A.length <= 12`
. `0 <= A[i] <= 1e9`
