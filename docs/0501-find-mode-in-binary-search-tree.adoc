== 501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-mode-in-binary-search-tree/[LeetCode - Find Mode in Binary Search Tree]

Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)[mode(s)] (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:


* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys *less than or equal to* the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys *greater than or equal to* the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.


 

For example:


Given BST `[1,null,2,2]`,

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
   1
    \
     2
    /
   2
----

 

return `[2]`.

*Note:* If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

*Follow up:* Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).
