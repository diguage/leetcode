= 3017. Count the Number of Houses at a Certain Distance II

{leetcode}/problems/count-the-number-of-houses-at-a-certain-distance-ii/[LeetCode - 3017. Count the Number of Houses at a Certain Distance II ^]

You are given three *positive* integers `n`, `x`, and `y`.

In a city, there exist houses numbered `1` to `n` connected by `n` streets. There is a street connecting the house numbered `i` with the house numbered `i + 1` for all `1 <= i <= n - 1` . An additional street connects the house numbered `x` with the house numbered `y`.

For each `k`, such that `1 <= k <= n`, you need to find the number of *pairs of houses* `(house<sub>1</sub>, house<sub>2</sub>)` such that the *minimum* number of streets that need to be traveled to reach `house<sub>2</sub>` from `house<sub>1</sub>` is `k`.

Return _a *1-indexed* array _`result`_ of length _`n`_ where _`result[k]`_ represents the *total* number of pairs of houses such that the *minimum* streets required to reach one house from the other is _`k`.

*Note* that `x` and `y` can be *equal*.

*Input:* n = 3, x = 1, y = 3
*Output:* [6,0,0]
*Explanation:* Let's look at each pair of houses:
- For the pair (1, 2), we can go from house 1 to house 2 directly.
- For the pair (2, 1), we can go from house 2 to house 1 directly.
- For the pair (1, 3), we can go from house 1 to house 3 directly.
- For the pair (3, 1), we can go from house 3 to house 1 directly.
- For the pair (2, 3), we can go from house 2 to house 3 directly.
- For the pair (3, 2), we can go from house 3 to house 2 directly.

*Input:* n = 5, x = 2, y = 4
*Output:* [10,8,2,0,0]
*Explanation:* For each distance k the pairs are:
- For k == 1, the pairs are (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5), and (5, 4).
- For k == 2, the pairs are (1, 3), (3, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (2, 5), (5, 2), (3, 5), and (5, 3).
- For k == 3, the pairs are (1, 5), and (5, 1).
- For k == 4 and k == 5, there are no pairs.

*Example 3:*

*Input:* n = 4, x = 1, y = 1
*Output:* [6,4,2,0]
*Explanation:* For each distance k the pairs are:
- For k == 1, the pairs are (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), and (4, 3).
- For k == 2, the pairs are (1, 3), (3, 1), (2, 4), and (4, 2).
- For k == 3, the pairs are (1, 4), and (4, 1).
- For k == 4, there are no pairs.

*Constraints:*


* `2 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= x, y <= n`
