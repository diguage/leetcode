= 697. Degree of an Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/degree-of-an-array/[LeetCode - Degree of an Array]

Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers `nums`, the *degree* of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements.
Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of `nums`, that has the same degree as `nums`.

*Example 1:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* 
The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice.
Of the subarrays that have the same degree:
[1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2]
The shortest length is 2. So return 2.

*Example 2:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [1,2,2,3,1,4,2]
*Output:* 6
----


*Note:*
. `nums.length` will be between 1 and 50,000.</li>
. `nums[i]` will be an integer between 0 and 49,999.</li>
