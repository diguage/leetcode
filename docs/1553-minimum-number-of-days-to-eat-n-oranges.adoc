= 1553. Minimum Number of Days to Eat N Oranges

{leetcode}/problems/minimum-number-of-days-to-eat-n-oranges/[LeetCode - 1553. Minimum Number of Days to Eat N Oranges ^]

There are `n` oranges in the kitchen and you decided to eat some of these oranges every day as follows:


* Eat one orange.
* If the number of remaining oranges `n` is divisible by `2` then you can eat `n / 2` oranges.
* If the number of remaining oranges `n` is divisible by `3` then you can eat `2 * (n / 3)` oranges.


You can only choose one of the actions per day.

Given the integer `n`, return _the minimum number of days to eat_ `n` _oranges_.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 10
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* You have 10 oranges.
Day 1: Eat 1 orange,  10 - 1 = 9.  
Day 2: Eat 6 oranges, 9 - 2*(9/3) = 9 - 6 = 3. (Since 9 is divisible by 3)
Day 3: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. 
Day 4: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.
You need at least 4 days to eat the 10 oranges.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 6
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* You have 6 oranges.
Day 1: Eat 3 oranges, 6 - 6/2 = 6 - 3 = 3. (Since 6 is divisible by 2).
Day 2: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. (Since 3 is divisible by 3)
Day 3: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.
You need at least 3 days to eat the 6 oranges.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^9^`
