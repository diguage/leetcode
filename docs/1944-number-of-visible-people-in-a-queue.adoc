= 1944. Number of Visible People in a Queue

{leetcode}/problems/number-of-visible-people-in-a-queue/[LeetCode - 1944. Number of Visible People in a Queue ^]

There are `n` people standing in a queue, and they numbered from `0` to `n - 1` in *left to right* order. You are given an array `heights` of *distinct* integers where `heights[i]` represents the height of the `i^th^` person.

A person can *see* another person to their right in the queue if everybody in between is *shorter* than both of them. More formally, the `i^th^` person can see the `j^th^` person if `i < j` and `min(heights[i], heights[j]) > max(heights[i+1], heights[i+2], ..., heights[j-1])`.

Return _an array _`answer`_ of length _`n`_ where _`answer[i]`_ is the *number of people* the _`i^th^`_ person can *see* to their right in the queue_.

 
*Example 1:*

*Input:* heights = [10,6,8,5,11,9]
*Output:* [3,1,2,1,1,0]
*Explanation:*
Person 0 can see person 1, 2, and 4.
Person 1 can see person 2.
Person 2 can see person 3 and 4.
Person 3 can see person 4.
Person 4 can see person 5.
Person 5 can see no one since nobody is to the right of them.

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* heights = [5,1,2,3,10]
*Output:* [4,1,1,1,0]
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == heights.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= heights[i] <= 10^5^`
* All the values of `heights` are *unique*.
