== 196. Delete Duplicate Emails

https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-duplicate-emails/[LeetCode - Delete Duplicate Emails]

Write a SQL query to *delete* all duplicate email entries in a table named `Person`, keeping only unique emails based on its _smallest_ *Id*.

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.
----

For example, after running your query, the above `Person` table should have the following rows:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
----

*Note:*

Your output is the whole `Person` table after executing your sql. Use `delete` statement.
