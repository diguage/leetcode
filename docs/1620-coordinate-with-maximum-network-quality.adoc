= 1620. Coordinate With Maximum Network Quality

{leetcode}/problems/coordinate-with-maximum-network-quality/[LeetCode - 1620. Coordinate With Maximum Network Quality ^]

You are given an array of network towers `towers`, where `towers[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, q<sub>i</sub>]` denotes the `i^th^` network tower with location `(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)` and quality factor `q<sub>i</sub>`. All the coordinates are *integral coordinates* on the X-Y plane, and the distance between the two coordinates is the *Euclidean distance*.

You are also given an integer `radius` where a tower is *reachable* if the distance is *less than or equal to* `radius`. Outside that distance, the signal becomes garbled, and the tower is *not reachable*.

The signal quality of the `i^th^` tower at a coordinate `(x, y)` is calculated with the formula `&lfloor;q<sub>i</sub> / (1 + d)&rfloor;`, where `d` is the distance between the tower and the coordinate. The *network quality* at a coordinate is the sum of the signal qualities from all the *reachable* towers.

Return _the array _`[c<sub>x</sub>, c<sub>y</sub>]`_ representing the *integral* coordinate _`(c<sub>x</sub>, c<sub>y</sub>)`_ where the *network quality* is maximum. If there are multiple coordinates with the same *network quality*, return the lexicographically minimum *non-negative* coordinate._

*Note:*


* A coordinate `(x1, y1)` is lexicographically smaller than `(x2, y2)` if either:

	
	* `x1 < x2`, or
	* `x1 == x2` and `y1 < y2`.
	
	
* `&lfloor;val&rfloor;` is the greatest integer less than or equal to `val` (the floor function).

*Input:* towers = [[1,2,5],[2,1,7],[3,1,9]], radius = 2
*Output:* [2,1]
*Explanation:* At coordinate (2, 1) the total quality is 13.
- Quality of 7 from (2, 1) results in &lfloor;7 / (1 + sqrt(0)&rfloor; = &lfloor;7&rfloor; = 7
- Quality of 5 from (1, 2) results in &lfloor;5 / (1 + sqrt(2)&rfloor; = &lfloor;2.07&rfloor; = 2
- Quality of 9 from (3, 1) results in &lfloor;9 / (1 + sqrt(1)&rfloor; = &lfloor;4.5&rfloor; = 4
No other coordinate has a higher network quality.

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* towers = [[23,11,21]], radius = 9
*Output:* [23,11]
*Explanation:* Since there is only one tower, the network quality is highest right at the tower's location.

----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* towers = [[1,2,13],[2,1,7],[0,1,9]], radius = 2
*Output:* [1,2]
*Explanation:* Coordinate (1, 2) has the highest network quality.

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= towers.length <= 50`
* `towers[i].length == 3`
* `0 <= x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, q<sub>i</sub> <= 50`
* `1 <= radius <= 50`
