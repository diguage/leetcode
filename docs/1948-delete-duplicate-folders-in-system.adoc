{leetcode}/problems/delete-duplicate-folders-in-system/[LeetCode - 1948. Delete Duplicate Folders in System ^]

Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are given a 2D array `paths`, where `paths[i]` is an array representing an absolute path to the `i^th^` folder in the file system.


* For example, `["one", "two", "three"]` represents the path `"/one/two/three"`.


Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are *identical* if they contain the *same non-empty* set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders *do not* need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are *identical*, then *mark* the folders as well as all their subfolders.


* For example, folders `"/a"` and `"/b"` in the file structure below are identical. They (as well as their subfolders) should *all* be marked:

	
	* `/a`
	* `/a/x`
	* `/a/x/y`
	* `/a/z`
	* `/b`
	* `/b/x`
	* `/b/x/y`
	* `/b/z`
	
	
* However, if the file structure also included the path `"/b/w"`, then the folders `"/a"` and `"/b"` would not be identical. Note that `"/a/x"` and `"/b/x"` would still be considered identical even with the added folder.


Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will *delete* all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.

Return _the 2D array _`ans` _containing the paths of the *remaining* folders after deleting all the marked folders. The paths may be returned in *any* order_.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/19/lc-dupfolder1.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 218px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* paths = [["a"],["c"],["d"],["a","b"],["c","b"],["d","a"]]
*Output:* [["d"],["d","a"]]
*Explanation:* The file structure is as shown.
Folders "/a" and "/c" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty
folder named "b".
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/19/lc-dupfolder2.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 355px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* paths = [["a"],["c"],["a","b"],["c","b"],["a","b","x"],["a","b","x","y"],["w"],["w","y"]]
*Output:* [["c"],["c","b"],["a"],["a","b"]]
*Explanation: *The file structure is as shown. 
Folders "/a/b/x" and "/w" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty folder named "y".
Note that folders "/a" and "/c" are identical after the deletion, but they are not deleted because they were not marked beforehand.

<strong class="example">Example 3:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/19/lc-dupfolder3.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 201px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* paths = [["a","b"],["c","d"],["c"],["a"]]
*Output:* [["c"],["c","d"],["a"],["a","b"]]
*Explanation:* All folders are unique in the file system.
Note that the returned array can be in a different order as the order does not matter.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= paths.length <= 2 * 10^4^`
* `1 <= paths[i].length <= 500`
* `1 <= paths[i][j].length <= 10`
* `1 <= sum(paths[i][j].length) <= 2 * 10^5^`
* `path[i][j]` consists of lowercase English letters.
* No two paths lead to the same folder.
* For any folder not at the root level, its parent folder will also be in the input.
