= 845. Longest Mountain in Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-mountain-in-array/[LeetCode - Longest Mountain in Array]

Let's call any (contiguous) subarray B (of A) a _mountain_ if the following properties hold:


* `B.length >= 3`
* There exists some `0 < i < B.length - 1` such that `B[0] < B[1] < ... B[i-1] < B[i] > B[i+1] > ... > B[B.length - 1]`


(Note that B could be any subarray of A, including the entire array A.)

Given an array `A` of integers, return the length of the longest _mountain_. 

Return `0` if there is no mountain.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [2,1,4,7,3,2,5]
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [2,2,2]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* There is no mountain.
----

*Note:*


* `0 <= A.length <= 10000`
* `0 <= A[i] <= 10000`


*Follow up:*


* Can you solve it using only one pass?
* Can you solve it in `O(1)` space?
