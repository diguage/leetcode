https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-tilt/[LeetCode - Binary Tree Tilt]

Given a binary tree, return the tilt of the *whole tree*.

The tilt of a *tree node* is defined as the *absolute difference* between the sum of all left subtree node values and the sum of all right subtree node values. Null node has tilt 0.

The tilt of the *whole tree* is defined as the sum of all nodes' tilt.

*Example:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* 
         1
       /   \
      2     3
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* 
Tilt of node 2 : 0
Tilt of node 3 : 0
Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1
Tilt of binary tree : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
----


*Note:*

. The sum of node values in any subtree won't exceed the range of 32-bit integer. 
. All the tilt values won't exceed the range of 32-bit integer.
