{leetcode}/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence/[LeetCode - Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence^]


Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.


*Example 1:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [1,3,5,4,7]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
----


*Example 2:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [2,2,2,2,2]
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
