== 57. Insert Interval

https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/[LeetCode - Insert Interval]

Given a set of _non-overlapping_ intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
*Output:* [[1,5],[6,9]]

----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* intervals = `[[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]]`, newInterval = `[4,8]`
*Output:* [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
*Explanation:* Because the new interval `[4,8]` overlaps with `[3,5],[6,7],[8,10]`.
