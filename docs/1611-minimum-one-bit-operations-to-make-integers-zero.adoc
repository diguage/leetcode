= 1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero

{leetcode}/problems/minimum-one-bit-operations-to-make-integers-zero/[LeetCode - 1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero ^]

Given an integer `n`, you must transform it into `0` using the following operations any number of times:


* Change the rightmost (`0^th^`) bit in the binary representation of `n`.
* Change the `i^th^` bit in the binary representation of `n` if the `(i-1)^th^` bit is set to `1` and the `(i-2)^th^` through `0^th^` bits are set to `0`.


Return _the minimum number of operations to transform _`n`_ into _`0`_._

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 3
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* The binary representation of 3 is "11".
"[.underline]#1#1" -> "[.underline]#0#1" with the 2^nd^ operation since the 0^th^ bit is 1.
"0[.underline]#1#" -> "0[.underline]#0#" with the 1^st^ operation.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 6
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* The binary representation of 6 is "110".
"[.underline]#1#10" -> "[.underline]#0#10" with the 2^nd^ operation since the 1^st^ bit is 1 and 0^th^ through 0^th^ bits are 0.
"01[.underline]#0#" -> "01[.underline]#1#" with the 1^st^ operation.
"0[.underline]#1#1" -> "0[.underline]#0#1" with the 2^nd^ operation since the 0^th^ bit is 1.
"00[.underline]#1#" -> "00[.underline]#0#" with the 1^st^ operation.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `0 <= n <= 10^9^`
