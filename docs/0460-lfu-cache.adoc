= 460. LFU Cache

https://leetcode.com/problems/lfu-cache/[LeetCode - LFU Cache]

Design and implement a data structure for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_frequently_used[Least Frequently Used (LFU)] cache. It should support the following operations: `get` and `put`.

`get(key)` - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.


`put(key, value)` - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate the least frequently used item before inserting a new item. For the purpose of this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys that have the same frequency), the least *recently* used key would be evicted.

Note that the number of times an item is used is the number of calls to the `get` and `put` functions for that item since it was inserted. This number is set to zero when the item is removed.

Could you do both operations in *O(1)* time complexity?

LFUCache cache = new LFUCache( 2 /* capacity */ );

cache.put(1, 1);
cache.put(2, 2);
cache.get(1);       // returns 1
cache.put(3, 3);    // evicts key 2
cache.get(2);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.get(3);       // returns 3.
cache.put(4, 4);    // evicts key 1.
cache.get(1);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.get(3);       // returns 3
cache.get(4);       // returns 4
