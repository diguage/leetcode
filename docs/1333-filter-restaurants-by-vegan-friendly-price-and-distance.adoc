= 1333. Filter Restaurants by Vegan-Friendly, Price and Distance

https://leetcode.com/problems/filter-restaurants-by-vegan-friendly-price-and-distance/[LeetCode - Filter Restaurants by Vegan-Friendly, Price and Distance^]

Given the array `restaurants` where  `restaurants[i] = [id~i~, rating~i~, veganFriendly~i~, price~i~, distance~i~]`. You have to filter the restaurants using three filters.

The `veganFriendly` filter will be either _true_ (meaning you should only include restaurants with `veganFriendly~i~` set to true) or _false_ (meaning you can include any restaurant). In addition, you have the filters `maxPrice` and `maxDistance` which are the maximum value for price and distance of restaurants you should consider respectively.

Return the array of restaurant _*IDs*_ after filtering, ordered by *rating* from highest to lowest. For restaurants with the same rating, order them by _*id*_ from highest to lowest. For simplicity `veganFriendly~i~` and `veganFriendly` take value _1_ when it is _true_, and _0_ when it is _false_.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10
*Output:* [3,1,5] 
*Explanation: 
*The restaurants are:
Restaurant 1 [id=1, rating=4, veganFriendly=1, price=40, distance=10]
Restaurant 2 [id=2, rating=8, veganFriendly=0, price=50, distance=5]
Restaurant 3 [id=3, rating=8, veganFriendly=1, price=30, distance=4]
Restaurant 4 [id=4, rating=10, veganFriendly=0, price=10, distance=3]
Restaurant 5 [id=5, rating=1, veganFriendly=1, price=15, distance=1] 
After filter restaurants with veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50 and maxDistance = 10 we have restaurant 3, restaurant 1 and restaurant 5 (ordered by rating from highest to lowest).

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 0, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10
*Output:* [4,3,2,1,5]
*Explanation:* The restaurants are the same as in example 1, but in this case the filter veganFriendly = 0, therefore all restaurants are considered.
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 0, maxPrice = 30, maxDistance = 3
*Output:* [4,5]
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= restaurants.length <= 10^4`
* `restaurants[i].length == 5`
* `1 <= id~i~, rating~i~, price~i~, distance~i ~<= 10^5`
* `1 <= maxPrice, maxDistance <= 10^5`
* `veganFriendly~i~` and `veganFriendly` are 0 or 1.
* All `id~i~` are distinct.
