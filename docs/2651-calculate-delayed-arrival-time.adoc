{leetcode}/problems/calculate-delayed-arrival-time/[LeetCode - 2651. Calculate Delayed Arrival Time ^]

You are given a positive integer `arrivalTime` denoting the arrival time of a train in hours, and another positive integer `delayedTime` denoting the amount of delay in hours.

Return _the time when the train will arrive at the station._

Note that the time in this problem is in 24-hours format.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* arrivalTime = 15, delayedTime = 5 
*Output:* 20 
*Explanation:* Arrival time of the train was 15:00 hours. It is delayed by 5 hours. Now it will reach at 15+5 = 20 (20:00 hours).
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* arrivalTime = 13, delayedTime = 11
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* Arrival time of the train was 13:00 hours. It is delayed by 11 hours. Now it will reach at 13+11=24 (Which is denoted by 00:00 in 24 hours format so return 0).
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= arrivaltime < 24`
* `1 <= delayedTime <= 24`
