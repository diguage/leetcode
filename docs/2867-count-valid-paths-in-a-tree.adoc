= 2867. Count Valid Paths in a Tree

{leetcode}/problems/count-valid-paths-in-a-tree/[LeetCode - 2867. Count Valid Paths in a Tree ^]

There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. You are given the integer `n` and a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `u<sub>i</sub>` and `v<sub>i</sub>` in the tree.

Return _the *number of valid paths* in the tree_.

A path `(a, b)` is *valid* if there exists *exactly one* prime number among the node labels in the path from `a` to `b`.

*Note* that:


* The path `(a, b)` is a sequence of *distinct* nodes starting with node `a` and ending with node `b` such that every two adjacent nodes in the sequence share an edge in the tree.
* Path `(a, b)` and path `(b, a)` are considered the *same* and counted only *once*.

*Input:* n = 5, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4],[2,5]]
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* The pairs with exactly one prime number on the path between them are: 
- (1, 2) since the path from 1 to 2 contains prime number 2. 
- (1, 3) since the path from 1 to 3 contains prime number 3.
- (1, 4) since the path from 1 to 4 contains prime number 2.
- (2, 4) since the path from 2 to 4 contains prime number 2.
It can be shown that there are only 4 valid paths.

*Input:* n = 6, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4],[3,5],[3,6]]
*Output:* 6
*Explanation:* The pairs with exactly one prime number on the path between them are: 
- (1, 2) since the path from 1 to 2 contains prime number 2.
- (1, 3) since the path from 1 to 3 contains prime number 3.
- (1, 4) since the path from 1 to 4 contains prime number 2.
- (1, 6) since the path from 1 to 6 contains prime number 3.
- (2, 4) since the path from 2 to 4 contains prime number 2.
- (3, 6) since the path from 3 to 6 contains prime number 3.
It can be shown that there are only 6 valid paths.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `edges.length == n - 1`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub> <= n`
* The input is generated such that `edges` represent a valid tree.
