= 1288. Remove Covered Intervals

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-covered-intervals/[LeetCode - Remove Covered Intervals]

Given a list of intervals, remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list. Interval `[a,b)` is covered by interval `[c,d)` if and only if `c <= a` and `b <= d`.

After doing so, return the number of remaining intervals.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], therefore it is removed.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= intervals.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= intervals[i][0] < intervals[i][1] <= 10^5`
* `intervals[i] != intervals[j]` for all `i != j`
