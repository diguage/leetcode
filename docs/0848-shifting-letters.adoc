{leetcode}/problems/shifting-letters/[LeetCode - Shifting Letters^]

We have a string `S` of lowercase letters, and an integer array `shifts`.

Call the _shift_ of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping around so that `'z'` becomes `'a'`). 

For example, `shift('a') = 'b'`, `shift('t') = 'u'`, and `shift('z') = 'a'`.

Now for each `shifts[i] = x`, we want to shift the first `i+1` letters of `S`, `x` times.

Return the final string after all such shifts to `S` are applied.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* S = "abc", shifts = [3,5,9]
*Output:* "rpl"
*Explanation:*
We start with "abc".
After shifting the first 1 letters of S by 3, we have "dbc".
After shifting the first 2 letters of S by 5, we have "igc".
After shifting the first 3 letters of S by 9, we have "rpl", the answer.
----

*Note:*


. `1 <= S.length = shifts.length <= 20000`
. `0 <= shifts[i] <= 10 ^ 9`
