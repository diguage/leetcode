= 2125. Number of Laser Beams in a Bank

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-laser-beams-in-a-bank/[LeetCode - 2125. Number of Laser Beams in a Bank ^]

Anti-theft security devices are activated inside a bank. You are given a *0-indexed* binary string array `bank` representing the floor plan of the bank, which is an `m x n` 2D matrix. `bank[i]` represents the `i^th^` row, consisting of `'0'`s and `'1'`s. `'0'` means the cell is empty, while`'1'` means the cell has a security device.

There is *one* laser beam between any *two* security devices *if both* conditions are met:


* The two devices are located on two *different rows*: `r<sub>1</sub>` and `r<sub>2</sub>`, where `r<sub>1</sub> < r<sub>2</sub>`.
* For *each* row `i` where `r<sub>1</sub> < i < r<sub>2</sub>`, there are *no security devices* in the `i^th^` row.


Laser beams are independent, i.e., one beam does not interfere nor join with another.

Return _the total number of laser beams in the bank_.

*Input:* bank = ["011001","000000","010100","001000"]
*Output:* 8
*Explanation:* Between each of the following device pairs, there is one beam. In total, there are 8 beams:
 * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[2][1] -- bank[3][2]
 * bank[2][3] -- bank[3][2]
Note that there is no beam between any device on the 0^th^ row with any on the 3^rd^ row.
This is because the 2^nd^ row contains security devices, which breaks the second condition.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/24/laser2.jpg" style="width: 244px; height: 325px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* bank = ["000","111","000"]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* There does not exist two devices located on two different rows.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `m == bank.length`
* `n == bank[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 500`
* `bank[i][j]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
