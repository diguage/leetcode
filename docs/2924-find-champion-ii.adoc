{leetcode}/problems/find-champion-ii/[LeetCode - 2924. Find Champion II ^]

There are `n` teams numbered from `0` to `n - 1` in a tournament; each team is also a node in a *DAG*.

You are given the integer `n` and a *0-indexed* 2D integer array `edges` of length `<font face="monospace">m` representing the *DAG*, where `edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]` indicates that there is a directed edge from team `u<sub>i</sub>` to team `v<sub>i</sub>` in the graph.

A directed edge from `a` to `b` in the graph means that team `a` is *stronger* than team `b` and team `b` is *weaker* than team `a`.

Team `a` will be the *champion* of the tournament if there is no team `b` that is *stronger* than team `a`.

Return _the team that will be the *champion* of the tournament if there is a *unique* champion, otherwise, return _`-1`_._

*Notes*


* A *cycle* is a series of nodes `a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>, a<sub>n+1</sub>` such that node `a<sub>1</sub>` is the same node as node `a<sub>n+1</sub>`, the nodes `a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>` are distinct, and there is a directed edge from the node `a<sub>i</sub>` to node `a<sub>i+1</sub>` for every `i` in the range `[1, n]`.
* A *DAG* is a directed graph that does not have any *cycle*.


 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

<img height="300" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/10/19/graph-3.png" width="300" />

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation: *Team 1 is weaker than team 0. Team 2 is weaker than team 1. So the champion is team 0.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

<img height="300" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/10/19/graph-4.png" width="300" />

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 4, edges = [[0,2],[1,3],[1,2]]
*Output:* -1
*Explanation:* Team 2 is weaker than team 0 and team 1. Team 3 is weaker than team 1. But team 1 and team 0 are not weaker than any other teams. So the answer is -1.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `m == edges.length`
* `0 <= m <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= edge[i][j] <= n - 1`
* `edges[i][0] != edges[i][1]`
* The input is generated such that if team `a` is stronger than team `b`, team `b` is not stronger than team `a`.
* The input is generated such that if team `a` is stronger than team `b` and team `b` is stronger than team `c`, then team `a` is stronger than team `c`.
