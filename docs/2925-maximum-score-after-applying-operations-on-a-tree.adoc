= 2925. Maximum Score After Applying Operations on a Tree

{leetcode}/problems/maximum-score-after-applying-operations-on-a-tree/[LeetCode - 2925. Maximum Score After Applying Operations on a Tree ^]

There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and rooted at node `0`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `a<sub>i</sub>` and `b<sub>i</sub>` in the tree.

You are also given a *0-indexed* integer array `values` of length `n`, where `values[i]` is the *value* associated with the `i^th^` node.

You start with a score of `0`. In one operation, you can:


* Pick any node `i`.
* Add `values[i]` to your score.
* Set `values[i]` to `0`.


A tree is *healthy* if the sum of values on the path from the root to any leaf node is different than zero.

Return _the *maximum score* you can obtain after performing these operations on the tree any number of times so that it remains *healthy*._

*Input:* edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,4],[4,5]], values = [5,2,5,2,1,1]
*Output:* 11
*Explanation:* We can choose nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The value of the root is non-zero. Hence, the sum of values on the path from the root to any leaf is different than zero. Therefore, the tree is healthy and the score is values[1] + values[2] + values[3] + values[4] + values[5] = 11.
It can be shown that 11 is the maximum score obtainable after any number of operations on the tree.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/10/11/graph-14-2.png" style="width: 522px; height: 245px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]

*Input:* edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]], values = [20,10,9,7,4,3,5]
*Output:* 40
*Explanation:* We can choose nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4.
- The sum of values on the path from 0 to 4 is equal to 10.
- The sum of values on the path from 0 to 3 is equal to 10.
- The sum of values on the path from 0 to 5 is equal to 3.
- The sum of values on the path from 0 to 6 is equal to 5.
Therefore, the tree is healthy and the score is values[0] + values[2] + values[3] + values[4] = 40.
It can be shown that 40 is the maximum score obtainable after any number of operations on the tree.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^4^`
* `edges.length == n - 1`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> < n`
* `values.length == n`
* `1 <= values[i] <= 10^9^`
* The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
