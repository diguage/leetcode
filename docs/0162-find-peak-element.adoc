== 162. Find Peak Element

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/[LeetCode - Find Peak Element]

A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

Given an input array `nums`, where `nums[i] &ne; nums[i+1]`, find a peak element and return its index.

The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -&infin;`.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* *nums* = `[1,2,3,1]`
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* *nums* = `[`1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
*Output:* 1 or 5 
*Explanation:* Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, 
             or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

----

*Note:*

Your solution should be in logarithmic complexity.
