= 933. Number of Recent Calls

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-recent-calls/[LeetCode - Number of Recent Calls]

Write a class `RecentCounter` to count recent requests.

It has only one method: `ping(int t)`, where t represents some time in milliseconds.

Return the number of `ping`s that have been made from 3000 milliseconds ago until now.

Any ping with time in `[t - 3000, t]` will count, including the current ping.

It is guaranteed that every call to `ping` uses a strictly larger value of `t` than before.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* inputs = ["RecentCounter","ping","ping","ping","ping"], inputs = [[],[1],[100],[3001],[3002]]
*Output:* [null,1,2,3,3]
----

 

*Note:*


. Each test case will have at most `10000` calls to `ping`.
. Each test case will call `ping` with strictly increasing values of `t`.
. Each call to ping will have `1 <= t <= 10^9`.
