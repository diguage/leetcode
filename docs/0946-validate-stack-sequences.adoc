{leetcode}/problems/validate-stack-sequences/[LeetCode - Validate Stack Sequences^]

Given two sequences `pushed` and `popped` *with distinct values*, return `true` if and only if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack.

 


*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
*Output:* true
*Explanation:* We might do the following sequence:
push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4), pop() -> 4,
push(5), pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
*Output:* false
*Explanation:* 1 cannot be popped before 2.
----

 

*Note:*


. `0 <= pushed.length == popped.length <= 1000`
. `0 <= pushed[i], popped[i] < 1000`
. `pushed` is a permutation of `popped`.
. `pushed` and `popped` have distinct values.
