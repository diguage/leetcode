Given an integer array `nums` where `nums[i]` is either a positive integer or `-1`. We need to find for each `-1` the respective positive integer, which we call the last visited integer.

To achieve this goal, let's define two empty arrays: `seen` and `ans`.

Start iterating from the beginning of the array `nums`.


* If a positive integer is encountered, prepend it to the *front* of `seen`.
* If `-1` is encountered, let `k` be the number of *consecutive* `-1`s seen so far (including the current `-1`),
	
	* If `k` is less than or equal to the length of `seen`, append the `k`-th element of `seen` to `ans`.
	* If `k` is strictly greater than the length of `seen`, append `-1` to `ans`.
	
	


Return the array_ _`ans`.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">nums = [1,2,-1,-1,-1]

*Output:* <span class="example-io">[2,1,-1]

*Explanation:*

Start with `seen = []` and `ans = []`.


* Process `nums[0]`: The first element in nums is `1`. We prepend it to the front of `seen`. Now, `seen == [1]`.
* Process `nums[1]`: The next element is `2`. We prepend it to the front of `seen`. Now, `seen == [2, 1]`.
* Process `nums[2]`: The next element is `-1`. This is the first occurrence of `-1`, so `k == 1`. We look for the first element in seen. We append `2` to `ans`. Now, `ans == [2]`.
* Process `nums[3]`: Another `-1`. This is the second consecutive `-1`, so `k == 2`. The second element in `seen` is `1`, so we append `1` to `ans`. Now, `ans == [2, 1]`.
* Process `nums[4]`: Another `-1`, the third in a row, making `k = 3`. However, `seen` only has two elements (`[2, 1]`). Since `k` is greater than the number of elements in `seen`, we append `-1` to `ans`. Finally, `ans == [2, 1, -1]`.



<strong class="example">Example 2:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">nums = [1,-1,2,-1,-1]

*Output:*<span class="example-io"> [1,2,1]

*Explanation:*

Start with `seen = []` and `ans = []`.


* Process `nums[0]`: The first element in nums is `1`. We prepend it to the front of `seen`. Now, `seen == [1]`.
* Process `nums[1]`: The next element is `-1`. This is the first occurrence of `-1`, so `k == 1`. We look for the first element in `seen`, which is `1`. Append `1` to `ans`. Now, `ans == [1]`.
* Process `nums[2]`: The next element is `2`. Prepend this to the front of `seen`. Now, `seen == [2, 1]`.
* Process `nums[3]`: The next element is `-1`. This `-1` is not consecutive to the first `-1` since `2` was in between. Thus, `k` resets to `1`. The first element in `seen` is `2`, so append `2` to `ans`. Now, `ans == [1, 2]`.
* Process `nums[4]`: Another `-1`. This is consecutive to the previous `-1`, so `k == 2`. The second element in `seen` is `1`, append `1` to `ans`. Finally, `ans == [1, 2, 1]`.



 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `nums[i] == -1` or `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
