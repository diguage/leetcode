= 1404. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-in-binary-representation-to-one/[LeetCode - 1404. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One ^]

Given the binary representation of an integer as a string `s`, return _the number of steps to reduce it to _`1`_ under the following rules_:


* 
	If the current number is even, you have to divide it by `2`.
	
* 
	If the current number is odd, you have to add `1` to it.
	


It is guaranteed that you can always reach one for all test cases.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "1101"
*Output:* 6
*Explanation:* "1101" corressponds to number 13 in their decimal representation.
Step 1) 13 is odd, add 1 and obtain 14. 
Step 2) 14 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 7.
Step 3) 7 is odd, add 1 and obtain 8.
Step 4) 8 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 4.  
Step 5) 4 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 2. 
Step 6) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1.  
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "10"
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* "10" corresponds to number 2 in their decimal representation.
Step 1) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1.  
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "1"
*Output:* 0
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= s.length <= 500`
* `s` consists of characters '0' or '1'
* `s[0] == '1'`
