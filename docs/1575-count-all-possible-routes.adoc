= 1575. Count All Possible Routes

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-all-possible-routes/[LeetCode - 1575. Count All Possible Routes ^]

You are given an array of *distinct* positive integers locations where `locations[i]` represents the position of city `i`. You are also given integers `start`, `finish` and `fuel` representing the starting city, ending city, and the initial amount of fuel you have, respectively.

At each step, if you are at city `i`, you can pick any city `j` such that `j != i` and `0 <= j < locations.length` and move to city `j`. Moving from city `i` to city `j` reduces the amount of fuel you have by `|locations[i] - locations[j]|`. Please notice that `|x|` denotes the absolute value of `x`.

Notice that `fuel` *cannot* become negative at any point in time, and that you are *allowed* to visit any city more than once (including `start` and `finish`).

Return _the count of all possible routes from _`start` _to_ `finish`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9^ + 7`.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* locations = [2,3,6,8,4], start = 1, finish = 3, fuel = 5
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* The following are all possible routes, each uses 5 units of fuel:
1 -> 3
1 -> 2 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* locations = [4,3,1], start = 1, finish = 0, fuel = 6
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* The following are all possible routes:
1 -> 0, used fuel = 1
1 -> 2 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 3
1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* locations = [5,2,1], start = 0, finish = 2, fuel = 3
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* It is impossible to get from 0 to 2 using only 3 units of fuel since the shortest route needs 4 units of fuel.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `2 <= locations.length <= 100`
* `1 <= locations[i] <= 10^9^`
* All integers in `locations` are *distinct*.
* `0 <= start, finish < locations.length`
* `1 <= fuel <= 200`
