{leetcode}/problems/recover-the-original-array/[LeetCode - 2122. Recover the Original Array ^]

Alice had a *0-indexed* array `arr` consisting of `n` *positive* integers. She chose an arbitrary *positive integer* `k` and created two new *0-indexed* integer arrays `lower` and `higher` in the following manner:


* `lower[i] = arr[i] - k`, for every index `i` where `0 <= i < n`
* `higher[i] = arr[i] + k`, for every index `i` where `0 <= i < n`


Unfortunately, Alice lost all three arrays. However, she remembers the integers that were present in the arrays `lower` and `higher`, but not the array each integer belonged to. Help Alice and recover the original array.

Given an array `nums` consisting of `2n` integers, where *exactly* `n` of the integers were present in `lower` and the remaining in `higher`, return _the *original* array_ `arr`. In case the answer is not unique, return _*any* valid array_.

*Note:* The test cases are generated such that there exists *at least one* valid array `arr`.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [2,10,6,4,8,12]
*Output:* [3,7,11]
*Explanation:*
If arr = [3,7,11] and k = 1, we get lower = [2,6,10] and higher = [4,8,12].
Combining lower and higher gives us [2,6,10,4,8,12], which is a permutation of nums.
Another valid possibility is that arr = [5,7,9] and k = 3. In that case, lower = [2,4,6] and higher = [8,10,12]. 
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [1,1,3,3]
*Output:* [2,2]
*Explanation:*
If arr = [2,2] and k = 1, we get lower = [1,1] and higher = [3,3].
Combining lower and higher gives us [1,1,3,3], which is equal to nums.
Note that arr cannot be [1,3] because in that case, the only possible way to obtain [1,1,3,3] is with k = 0.
This is invalid since k must be positive.
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [5,435]
*Output:* [220]
*Explanation:*
The only possible combination is arr = [220] and k = 215. Using them, we get lower = [5] and higher = [435].
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `2 * n == nums.length`
* `1 <= n <= 1000`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9^`
* The test cases are generated such that there exists *at least one* valid array `arr`.
