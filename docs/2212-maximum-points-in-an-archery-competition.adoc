Alice and Bob are opponents in an archery competition. The competition has set the following rules:


* Alice first shoots `numArrows` arrows and then Bob shoots `numArrows` arrows.
* The points are then calculated as follows:
	
	* The target has integer scoring sections ranging from `0` to `11` *inclusive*.
	* For *each* section of the target with score `k` (in between `0` to `11`), say Alice and Bob have shot `a<sub>k</sub>` and `b<sub>k</sub>` arrows on that section respectively. If `a<sub>k</sub> >= b<sub>k</sub>`, then Alice takes `k` points. If `a<sub>k</sub> < b<sub>k</sub>`, then Bob takes `k` points.
	* However, if `a<sub>k</sub> == b<sub>k</sub> == 0`, then *nobody* takes `k` points.
	
	



* 
	For example, if Alice and Bob both shot `2` arrows on the section with score `11`, then Alice takes `11` points. On the other hand, if Alice shot `0` arrows on the section with score `11` and Bob shot `2` arrows on that same section, then Bob takes `11` points.
	


You are given the integer `numArrows` and an integer array `aliceArrows` of size `12`, which represents the number of arrows Alice shot on each scoring section from `0` to `11`. Now, Bob wants to *maximize* the total number of points he can obtain.

Return _the array _`bobArrows`_ which represents the number of arrows Bob shot on *each* scoring section from _`0`_ to _`11`. The sum of the values in `bobArrows` should equal `numArrows`.

If there are multiple ways for Bob to earn the maximum total points, return *any* one of them.

 
*Example 1:*

*Input:* numArrows = 9, aliceArrows = [1,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,1,2,0]
*Output:* [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,2,3,1]
*Explanation:* The table above shows how the competition is scored. 
Bob earns a total point of 4 + 5 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 47.
It can be shown that Bob cannot obtain a score higher than 47 points.

*Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/24/ex2new.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 117px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* numArrows = 3, aliceArrows = [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]
*Output:* [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]
*Explanation:* The table above shows how the competition is scored.
Bob earns a total point of 8 + 9 + 10 = 27.
It can be shown that Bob cannot obtain a score higher than 27 points.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= numArrows <= 10^5^`
* `aliceArrows.length == bobArrows.length == 12`
* `0 <= aliceArrows[i], bobArrows[i] <= numArrows`
* `sum(aliceArrows[i]) == numArrows`
