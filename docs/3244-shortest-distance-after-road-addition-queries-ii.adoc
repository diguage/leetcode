= 3244. Shortest Distance After Road Addition Queries II

https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-after-road-addition-queries-ii/[LeetCode - 3244. Shortest Distance After Road Addition Queries II ^]

You are given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `queries`.

There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Initially, there is a *unidirectional* road from city `i` to city `i + 1` for all `0 <= i < n - 1`.

`queries[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]` represents the addition of a new *unidirectional* road from city `u<sub>i</sub>` to city `v<sub>i</sub>`. After each query, you need to find the *length* of the *shortest path* from city `0` to city `n - 1`.

There are no two queries such that `queries[i][0] < queries[j][0] < queries[i][1] < queries[j][1]`.

Return an array `answer` where for each `i` in the range `[0, queries.length - 1]`, `answer[i]` is the _length of the shortest path_ from city `0` to city `n - 1` after processing the *first *`i + 1` queries.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">n = 5, queries = [[2,4],[0,2],[0,4]]

*Output:* <span class="example-io">[3,2,1]

*Explanation: *

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/28/image8.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 60px;" />

After the addition of the road from 2 to 4, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 3.

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/28/image9.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 60px;" />

After the addition of the road from 0 to 2, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 2.

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/28/image10.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 96px;" />

After the addition of the road from 0 to 4, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 1.


<strong class="example">Example 2:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">n = 4, queries = [[0,3],[0,2]]

*Output:* <span class="example-io">[1,1]

*Explanation:*

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/28/image11.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 70px;" />

After the addition of the road from 0 to 3, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 3 is 1.

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/28/image12.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 70px;" />

After the addition of the road from 0 to 2, the length of the shortest path remains 1.


 
*Constraints:*


* `3 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5^`
* `queries[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= queries[i][0] < queries[i][1] < n`
* `1 < queries[i][1] - queries[i][0]`
* There are no repeated roads among the queries.
* There are no two queries such that `i != j` and `queries[i][0] < queries[j][0] < queries[i][1] < queries[j][1]`.
