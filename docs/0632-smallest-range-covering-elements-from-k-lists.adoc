== 632. Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists

https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-range-covering-elements-from-k-lists/[LeetCode - Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists]

You have `k` lists of sorted integers in ascending order. Find the *smallest* range that includes at least one number from each of the `k` lists.

We define the range [a,b] is smaller than range [c,d] if `b-a < d-c` or `a < c` if `b-a == d-c`.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]]
*Output:* [20,24]
*Explanation:* 
List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].
List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].
List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range [20,24].
----

 

*Note:*


. The given list may contain duplicates, so ascending order means >= here.
. 1 <= `k` <= 3500
. -10^5^ <= `value of elements` <= 10^5^.
