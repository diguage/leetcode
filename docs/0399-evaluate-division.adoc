= 399. Evaluate Division

https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division/[LeetCode - Evaluate Division]

Equations are given in the format `A / B = k`, where `A` and `B` are variables represented as strings, and `k` is a real number (floating point number). Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return `-1.0`.

*Example:*


Given ` a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0.`


queries are: ` a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? .`


return ` [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ].`

The input is: ` vector<pair<string, string>> equations, vector<double>&amp; values, vector<pair<string, string>> queries `, where `equations.size() == values.size()`, and the values are positive. This represents the equations. Return ` vector<double>`.

According to the example above:

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
equations = [ ["a", "b"], ["b", "c"] ],
values = [2.0, 3.0],
queries = [ ["a", "c"], ["b", "a"], ["a", "e"], ["a", "a"], ["x", "x"] ]. 
----

 

The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will result in no division by zero and there is no contradiction.
