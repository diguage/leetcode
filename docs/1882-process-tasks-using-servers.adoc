{leetcode}/problems/process-tasks-using-servers/[LeetCode - 1882. Process Tasks Using Servers ^]

You are given two *0-indexed* integer arrays `servers` and `tasks` of lengths `n`​​​​​​ and `m`​​​​​​ respectively. `servers[i]` is the *weight* of the `i^​​​​​​th^`​​​​ server, and `tasks[j]` is the *time needed* to process the `j^​​​​​​th^`​​​​ task *in seconds*.

Tasks are assigned to the servers using a *task queue*. Initially, all servers are free, and the queue is *empty*.

At second `j`, the `j^th^` task is *inserted* into the queue (starting with the `0^th^` task being inserted at second `0`). As long as there are free servers and the queue is not empty, the task in the front of the queue will be assigned to a free server with the *smallest weight*, and in case of a tie, it is assigned to a free server with the *smallest index*.

If there are no free servers and the queue is not empty, we wait until a server becomes free and immediately assign the next task. If multiple servers become free at the same time, then multiple tasks from the queue will be assigned *in order of insertion* following the weight and index priorities above.

A server that is assigned task `j` at second `t` will be free again at second `t + tasks[j]`.

Build an array `ans`​​​​ of length `m`, where `ans[j]` is the *index* of the server the `j^​​​​​​th^` task will be assigned to.

Return _the array _`ans`​​​​.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* servers = [3,3,2], tasks = [1,2,3,2,1,2]
*Output:* [2,2,0,2,1,2]
*Explanation: *Events in chronological order go as follows:
- At second 0, task 0 is added and processed using server 2 until second 1.
- At second 1, server 2 becomes free. Task 1 is added and processed using server 2 until second 3.
- At second 2, task 2 is added and processed using server 0 until second 5.
- At second 3, server 2 becomes free. Task 3 is added and processed using server 2 until second 5.
- At second 4, task 4 is added and processed using server 1 until second 5.
- At second 5, all servers become free. Task 5 is added and processed using server 2 until second 7.

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* servers = [5,1,4,3,2], tasks = [2,1,2,4,5,2,1]
*Output:* [1,4,1,4,1,3,2]
*Explanation: *Events in chronological order go as follows: 
- At second 0, task 0 is added and processed using server 1 until second 2.
- At second 1, task 1 is added and processed using server 4 until second 2.
- At second 2, servers 1 and 4 become free. Task 2 is added and processed using server 1 until second 4. 
- At second 3, task 3 is added and processed using server 4 until second 7.
- At second 4, server 1 becomes free. Task 4 is added and processed using server 1 until second 9. 
- At second 5, task 5 is added and processed using server 3 until second 7.
- At second 6, task 6 is added and processed using server 2 until second 7.

*Constraints:*


* `servers.length == n`
* `tasks.length == m`
* `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5^`
* `1 <= servers[i], tasks[j] <= 2 * 10^5^`
