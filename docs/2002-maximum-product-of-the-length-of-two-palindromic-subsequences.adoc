= 2002. Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Subsequences

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-the-length-of-two-palindromic-subsequences/[LeetCode - 2002. Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Subsequences ^]

Given a string `s`, find two *disjoint palindromic subsequences* of `s` such that the *product* of their lengths is *maximized*. The two subsequences are *disjoint* if they do not both pick a character at the same index.

Return _the *maximum* possible *product* of the lengths of the two palindromic subsequences_.

A *subsequence* is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. A string is *palindromic* if it reads the same forward and backward.

----
*Input:* s = "leetcodecom"
*Output:* 9
*Explanation*: An optimal solution is to choose "ete" for the 1^st^ subsequence and "cdc" for the 2^nd^ subsequence.
The product of their lengths is: 3 * 3 = 9.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "bb"
*Output:* 1
*Explanation*: An optimal solution is to choose "b" (the first character) for the 1^st^ subsequence and "b" (the second character) for the 2^nd^ subsequence.
The product of their lengths is: 1 * 1 = 1.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "accbcaxxcxx"
*Output:* 25
*Explanation*: An optimal solution is to choose "accca" for the 1^st^ subsequence and "xxcxx" for the 2^nd^ subsequence.
The product of their lengths is: 5 * 5 = 25.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `2 <= s.length <= 12`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.
