= 2545. Sort the Students by Their Kth Score

{leetcode}/problems/sort-the-students-by-their-kth-score/[LeetCode - 2545. Sort the Students by Their Kth Score ^]

There is a class with `m` students and `n` exams. You are given a *0-indexed* `m x n` integer matrix `score`, where each row represents one student and `score[i][j]` denotes the score the `i^th^` student got in the `j^th^` exam. The matrix `score` contains *distinct* integers only.

You are also given an integer `k`. Sort the students (i.e., the rows of the matrix) by their scores in the `k^th^` (*0-indexed*) exam from the highest to the lowest.

Return _the matrix after sorting it._

*Input:* score = [[10,6,9,1],[7,5,11,2],[4,8,3,15]], k = 2
*Output:* [[7,5,11,2],[10,6,9,1],[4,8,3,15]]
*Explanation:* In the above diagram, S denotes the student, while E denotes the exam.
- The student with index 1 scored 11 in exam 2, which is the highest score, so they got first place.
- The student with index 0 scored 9 in exam 2, which is the second highest score, so they got second place.
- The student with index 2 scored 3 in exam 2, which is the lowest score, so they got third place.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

*Input:* score = [[3,4],[5,6]], k = 0
*Output:* [[5,6],[3,4]]
*Explanation:* In the above diagram, S denotes the student, while E denotes the exam.
- The student with index 1 scored 5 in exam 0, which is the highest score, so they got first place.
- The student with index 0 scored 3 in exam 0, which is the lowest score, so they got second place.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `m == score.length`
* `n == score[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 250`
* `1 <= score[i][j] <= 10^5^`
* `score` consists of *distinct* integers.
* `0 <= k < n`
