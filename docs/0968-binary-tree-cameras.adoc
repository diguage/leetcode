https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/[LeetCode - Binary Tree Cameras]

Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 

Each camera at a node can monitor *its parent, itself, and its immediate children*.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.
