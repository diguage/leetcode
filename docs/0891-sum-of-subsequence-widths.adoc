= 891. Sum of Subsequence Widths

https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subsequence-widths/[LeetCode - Sum of Subsequence Widths]

Given an array of integers `A`, consider all non-empty subsequences of `A`.

For any sequence S, let the _width_ of S be the difference between the maximum and minimum element of S.

Return the sum of the widths of all subsequences of A. 

As the answer may be very large, *return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7*.


 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [2,1,3]
*Output:* 6
*Explanation:*
Subsequences are [1], [2], [3], [2,1], [2,3], [1,3], [2,1,3].
The corresponding widths are 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2.
The sum of these widths is 6.

*Note:*


* `1 <= A.length <= 20000`
* `1 <= A[i] <= 20000`
