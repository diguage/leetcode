= 332. Reconstruct Itinerary

https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/[LeetCode - Reconstruct Itinerary^]

Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports `[from, to]`, reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `JFK`. Thus, the itinerary must begin with `JFK`.

*Note:*


. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.
. All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
. You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.


*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* `[["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]`
*Output:* `["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]`
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* `[["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]`
*Output:* `["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]`
*Explanation:* Another possible reconstruction is `["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"]`.
             But it is larger in lexical order.
