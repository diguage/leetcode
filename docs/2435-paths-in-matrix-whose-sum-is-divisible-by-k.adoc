= 2435. Paths in Matrix Whose Sum Is Divisible by K

{leetcode}/problems/paths-in-matrix-whose-sum-is-divisible-by-k/[LeetCode - 2435. Paths in Matrix Whose Sum Is Divisible by K ^]

You are given a *0-indexed* `m x n` integer matrix `grid` and an integer `k`. You are currently at position `(0, 0)` and you want to reach position `(m - 1, n - 1)` moving only *down* or *right*.

Return_ the number of paths where the sum of the elements on the path is divisible by _`k`. Since the answer may be very large, return it *modulo* `10^9^ + 7`.

 
*Example 1:*

*Input:* grid = [[5,2,4],[3,0,5],[0,7,2]], k = 3
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* There are two paths where the sum of the elements on the path is divisible by k.
The first path highlighted in red has a sum of 5 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 18 which is divisible by 3.
The second path highlighted in blue has a sum of 5 + 3 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 15 which is divisible by 3.
----

*Example 2:*
<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/08/17/image-20220817112930-3.png" style="height: 85px; width: 132px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* grid = [[0,0]], k = 5
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* The path highlighted in red has a sum of 0 + 0 = 0 which is divisible by 5.
----

*Example 3:*
<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/08/12/image-20220812224605-3.png" style="width: 257px; height: 200px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* grid = [[7,3,4,9],[2,3,6,2],[2,3,7,0]], k = 1
*Output:* 10
*Explanation:* Every integer is divisible by 1 so the sum of the elements on every possible path is divisible by k.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 5 * 10^4^`
* `1 <= m * n <= 5 * 10^4^`
* `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
* `1 <= k <= 50`
