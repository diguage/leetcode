= 805. Split Array With Same Average

https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-with-same-average/[LeetCode - Split Array With Same Average]

In a given integer array A, we must move every element of A to either list B or list C. (B and C initially start empty.)

Return true if and only if after such a move, it is possible that the average value of B is equal to the average value of C, and B and C are both non-empty.
