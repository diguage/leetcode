= 526. Beautiful Arrangement

https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-arrangement/[LeetCode - Beautiful Arrangement]

Suppose you have *N* integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these *N* numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the i~th~ position (1 <= i <= N) in this array:


. The number at the i~th~ position is divisible by *i*.
. *i* is divisible by the number at the i~th~ position.


 

Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* 2
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* 

The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).

The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.

*Note:*


. *N* is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.
