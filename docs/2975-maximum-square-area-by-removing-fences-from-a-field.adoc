= 2975. Maximum Square Area by Removing Fences From a Field

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-square-area-by-removing-fences-from-a-field/[LeetCode - 2975. Maximum Square Area by Removing Fences From a Field ^]

There is a large `(m - 1) x (n - 1)` rectangular field with corners at `(1, 1)` and `(m, n)` containing some horizontal and vertical fences given in arrays `hFences` and `vFences` respectively.

Horizontal fences are from the coordinates `(hFences[i], 1)` to `(hFences[i], n)` and vertical fences are from the coordinates `(1, vFences[i])` to `(m, vFences[i])`.

Return _the *maximum* area of a *square* field that can be formed by *removing* some fences (*possibly none*) or _`-1` _if it is impossible to make a square field_.

Since the answer may be large, return it *modulo* `10^9 ^+ 7`.

*Note: *The field is surrounded by two horizontal fences from the coordinates `(1, 1)` to `(1, n)` and `(m, 1)` to `(m, n)` and two vertical fences from the coordinates `(1, 1)` to `(m, 1)` and `(1, n)` to `(m, n)`. These fences *cannot* be removed.

----
*Input:* m = 4, n = 3, hFences = [2,3], vFences = [2]
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* Removing the horizontal fence at 2 and the vertical fence at 2 will give a square field of area 4.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/11/22/maxsquareareaexample1.png" style="width: 285px; height: 242px;" />

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* m = 6, n = 7, hFences = [2], vFences = [4]
*Output:* -1
*Explanation:* It can be proved that there is no way to create a square field by removing fences.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `3 <= m, n <= 10^9^`
* `<font face="monospace">1 <= hFences<font face="monospace">.length, vFences.length <= 600`
* `<font face="monospace">1 < hFences[i] < m`
* `<font face="monospace">1 < vFences[i] < n`
* `<font face="monospace">hFences`<font face="monospace"> and `<font face="monospace">vFences`<font face="monospace"> are unique.
