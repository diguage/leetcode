= 2606. Find the Substring With Maximum Cost

{leetcode}/problems/find-the-substring-with-maximum-cost/[LeetCode - 2606. Find the Substring With Maximum Cost ^]

You are given a string `s`, a string `chars` of *distinct* characters and an integer array `vals` of the same length as `chars`.

The *cost of the substring *is the sum of the values of each character in the substring. The cost of an empty string is considered `0`.

The *value of the character *is defined in the following way:


* If the character is not in the string `chars`, then its value is its corresponding position *(1-indexed)* in the alphabet.

	
	* For example, the value of `'a'` is `1`, the value of `'b'` is `2`, and so on. The value of `'z'` is `26`.
	
	
* Otherwise, assuming `i` is the index where the character occurs in the string `chars`, then its value is `vals[i]`.


Return _the maximum cost among all substrings of the string_ `s`.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "adaa", chars = "d", vals = [-1000]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* The value of the characters "a" and "d" is 1 and -1000 respectively.
The substring with the maximum cost is "aa" and its cost is 1 + 1 = 2.
It can be proven that 2 is the maximum cost.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "abc", chars = "abc", vals = [-1,-1,-1]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* The value of the characters "a", "b" and "c" is -1, -1, and -1 respectively.
The substring with the maximum cost is the empty substring "" and its cost is 0.
It can be proven that 0 is the maximum cost.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5^`
* `s` consist of lowercase English letters.
* `1 <= chars.length <= 26`
* `chars` consist of *distinct* lowercase English letters.
* `vals.length == chars.length`
* `-1000 <= vals[i] <= 1000`
