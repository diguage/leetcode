= 823. Binary Trees With Factors

https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-trees-with-factors/[LeetCode - Binary Trees With Factors]

Given an array of unique integers, each integer is strictly greater than 1.

We make a binary tree using these integers and each number may be used for any number of times.

Each non-leaf node's value should be equal to the product of the values of it's children.

How many binary trees can we make?  Return the answer *modulo 10 ** 9 + 7*.

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* `A = [2, 4]`
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* We can make these trees: `[2], [4], [4, 2, 2]`
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* `A = [2, 4, 5, 10]`
*Output:* `7`
*Explanation:* We can make these trees: `[2], [4], [5], [10], [4, 2, 2], [10, 2, 5], [10, 5, 2]`.
----

 

*Note:*


. `1 <= A.length <= 1000`.
. `2 <= A[i] <= 10 ^ 9`.
