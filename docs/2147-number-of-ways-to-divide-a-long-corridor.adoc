= 2147. Number of Ways to Divide a Long Corridor

{leetcode}/problems/number-of-ways-to-divide-a-long-corridor/[LeetCode - 2147. Number of Ways to Divide a Long Corridor ^]

Along a long library corridor, there is a line of seats and decorative plants. You are given a *0-indexed* string `corridor` of length `n` consisting of letters `'S'` and `'P'` where each `'S'` represents a seat and each `'P'` represents a plant.

One room divider has *already* been installed to the left of index `0`, and *another* to the right of index `n - 1`. Additional room dividers can be installed. For each position between indices `i - 1` and `i` (`1 <= i <= n - 1`), at most one divider can be installed.

Divide the corridor into non-overlapping sections, where each section has *exactly two seats* with any number of plants. There may be multiple ways to perform the division. Two ways are *different* if there is a position with a room divider installed in the first way but not in the second way.

Return _the number of ways to divide the corridor_. Since the answer may be very large, return it *modulo* `10^9^ + 7`. If there is no way, return `0`.

*Input:* corridor = "SSPPSPS"
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* There are 3 different ways to divide the corridor.
The black bars in the above image indicate the two room dividers already installed.
Note that in each of the ways, *each* section has exactly *two* seats.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/04/2.png" style="width: 357px; height: 68px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* corridor = "PPSPSP"
*Output:* 1
*Explanation:* There is only 1 way to divide the corridor, by not installing any additional dividers.
Installing any would create some section that does not have exactly two seats.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/12/3.png" style="width: 115px; height: 68px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* corridor = "S"
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* There is no way to divide the corridor because there will always be a section that does not have exactly two seats.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == corridor.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `corridor[i]` is either `'S'` or `'P'`.
