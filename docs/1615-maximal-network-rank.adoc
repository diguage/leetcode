= 1615. Maximal Network Rank

{leetcode}/problems/maximal-network-rank/[LeetCode - 1615. Maximal Network Rank ^]

There is an infrastructure of `n` cities with some number of `roads` connecting these cities. Each `roads[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]` indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities `a<sub>i</sub>` and `b<sub>i</sub>`.

The *network rank*_ _of *two different cities* is defined as the total number of *directly* connected roads to *either* city. If a road is directly connected to both cities, it is only counted *once*.

The *maximal network rank *of the infrastructure is the *maximum network rank* of all pairs of different cities.

Given the integer `n` and the array `roads`, return _the *maximal network rank* of the entire infrastructure_.

*Input:* n = 4, roads = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
*Output:* 4
*Explanation:* The network rank of cities 0 and 1 is 4 as there are 4 roads that are connected to either 0 or 1. The road between 0 and 1 is only counted once.
----

*Example 2:*

*<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/ex2.png" style="width: 292px; height: 172px;" />*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 5, roads = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[2,4]]
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* There are 5 roads that are connected to cities 1 or 2.
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 8, roads = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[5,6],[5,7]]
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* The network rank of 2 and 5 is 5. Notice that all the cities do not have to be connected.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `2 <= n <= 100`
* `0 <= roads.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
* `roads[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> <= n-1`
* `a<sub>i</sub> != b<sub>i</sub>`
* Each pair of cities has *at most one* road connecting them.
