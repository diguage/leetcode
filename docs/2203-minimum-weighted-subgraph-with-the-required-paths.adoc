= 2203. Minimum Weighted Subgraph With the Required Paths

{leetcode}/problems/minimum-weighted-subgraph-with-the-required-paths/[LeetCode - 2203. Minimum Weighted Subgraph With the Required Paths ^]

You are given an integer `n` denoting the number of nodes of a *weighted directed* graph. The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>, weight<sub>i</sub>]` denotes that there exists a *directed* edge from `from<sub>i</sub>` to `to<sub>i</sub>` with weight `weight<sub>i</sub>`.

Lastly, you are given three *distinct* integers `src1`, `src2`, and `dest` denoting three distinct nodes of the graph.

Return _the *minimum weight* of a subgraph of the graph such that it is *possible* to reach_ `dest` _from both_ `src1` _and_ `src2` _via a set of edges of this subgraph_. In case such a subgraph does not exist, return `-1`.

A *subgraph* is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the original graph. The *weight* of a subgraph is the sum of weights of its constituent edges.

 
*Example 1:*

*Input:* n = 6, edges = [[0,2,2],[0,5,6],[1,0,3],[1,4,5],[2,1,1],[2,3,3],[2,3,4],[3,4,2],[4,5,1]], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 5
*Output:* 9
*Explanation:*
The above figure represents the input graph.
The blue edges represent one of the subgraphs that yield the optimal answer.
Note that the subgraph [[1,0,3],[0,5,6]] also yields the optimal answer. It is not possible to get a subgraph with less weight satisfying all the constraints.

*Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/17/example2-1drawio.png" style="width: 350px; height: 51px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1],[2,1,1]], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 2
*Output:* -1
*Explanation:*
The above figure represents the input graph.
It can be seen that there does not exist any path from node 1 to node 2, hence there are no subgraphs satisfying all the constraints.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `3 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `0 <= edges.length <= 10^5^`
* `edges[i].length == 3`
* `0 <= from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>, src1, src2, dest <= n - 1`
* `from<sub>i</sub> != to<sub>i</sub>`
* `src1`, `src2`, and `dest` are pairwise distinct.
* `1 <= weight[i] <= 10^5^`
