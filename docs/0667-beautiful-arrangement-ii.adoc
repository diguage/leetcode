Given two integers `n` and `k`, you need to construct a list which contains `n` different positive integers ranging from `1` to `n` and obeys the following requirement: <br/>

Suppose this list is [a~1~, a~2~, a~3~, ... , a~n~], then the list [|a~1~ - a~2~|, |a~2~ - a~3~|, |a~3~ - a~4~|, ... , |a~n-1~ - a~n~|] has exactly `k` distinct integers.



If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


*Example 1:*<br/>
[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 3, k = 1
*Output:* [1, 2, 3]
*Explanation:* The [1, 2, 3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1, 1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1.
----


*Example 2:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 3, k = 2
*Output:* [1, 3, 2]
*Explanation:* The [1, 3, 2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2, 1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.
----


*Note:*

. The `n` and `k` are in the range 1 <= k < n <= 10^4^.
