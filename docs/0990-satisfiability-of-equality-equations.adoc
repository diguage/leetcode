= 990. Satisfiability of Equality Equations

{leetcode}/problems/satisfiability-of-equality-equations/[LeetCode - Satisfiability of Equality Equations^]

Given an array <font face="monospace">equations of strings that represent relationships between variables, each string `equations[i]` has length `4` and takes one of two different forms: `"a==b"` or `"a!=b"`.  Here, `a` and `b` are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.

Return `true` if and only if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations.

 





*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* ["a==b","b!=a"]
*Output:* false
*Explanation:* If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.  There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* ["b==a","a==b"]
*Output:* true
*Explanation:* We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.
----


*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* ["a==b","b==c","a==c"]
*Output:* true
----


*Example 4:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* ["a==b","b!=c","c==a"]
*Output:* false
----


*Example 5:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* ["c==c","b==d","x!=z"]
*Output:* true
----

 

*Note:*


. `1 <= equations.length <= 500`
. `equations[i].length == 4`
. `equations[i][0]` and `equations[i][3]` are lowercase letters
. `equations[i][1]` is either `'='` or `'!'`
. `equations[i][2]` is `'='`
