= 998. Maximum Binary Tree II

{leetcode}/problems/maximum-binary-tree-ii/[LeetCode - Maximum Binary Tree II^]

We are given the `root` node of a _maximum tree:_ a tree where every node has a value greater than any other value in its subtree.

Just as in the <a href="{leetcode}/problems/maximum-binary-tree/">previous problem</a>, the given tree was constructed from an list `A` (`root = Construct(A)`) recursively with the following `Construct(A)` routine:


* If `A` is empty, return `null`.
* Otherwise, let `A[i]` be the largest element of `A`.  Create a `root` node with value `A[i]`.
* The left child of `root` will be `Construct([A[0], A[1], ..., A[i-1]])`
* The right child of `root` will be `Construct([A[i+1], A[i+2], ..., A[A.length - 1]])`
* Return `root`.


Note that we were not given A directly, only a root node `root = Construct(A)`.

Suppose `B` is a copy of `A` with the value `val` appended to it.  It is guaranteed that `B` has unique values.

Return `Construct(B)`.
