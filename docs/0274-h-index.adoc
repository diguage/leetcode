= 274. H-Index

{leetcode}/problems/h-index/[LeetCode - H-Index^]

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index[definition of h-index on Wikipedia^]: "A scientist has index _h_ if _h_ of his/her _N_ papers have *at least* _h_ citations each, and the other _N - h_ papers have *no more than* _h_ citations each."

*Example:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* `citations = [3,0,6,1,5]`
*Output:* 3 
*Explanation:* `[3,0,6,1,5] `means the researcher has `5` papers in total and each of them had 
             received `3, 0, 6, 1, 5` citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has `3` papers with *at least* `3` citations each and the remaining 
             two with *no more than* `3` citations each, her h-index is `3`.
----

*Note: *If there are several possible values for _h_, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
