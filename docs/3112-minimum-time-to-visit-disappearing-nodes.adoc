= 3112. Minimum Time to Visit Disappearing Nodes

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-visit-disappearing-nodes/[LeetCode - 3112. Minimum Time to Visit Disappearing Nodes ^]

There is an undirected graph of `n` nodes. You are given a 2D array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, length<sub>i</sub>]` describes an edge between node `u<sub>i</sub>` and node `v<sub>i</sub>` with a traversal time of `length<sub>i</sub>` units.

Additionally, you are given an array `disappear`, where `disappear[i]` denotes the time when the node `i` disappears from the graph and you won't be able to visit it.

*Notice* that the graph might be disconnected and might contain multiple edges.

Return the array `answer`, with `answer[i]` denoting the *minimum* units of time required to reach node `i` from node 0. If node `i` is *unreachable* from node 0 then `answer[i]` is `-1`.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

<img 10px="" alt="" padding:="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/03/09/example1.png" style="width: 350px; height: 210px;" />

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io"> n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,1],[0,2,4]], disappear = [1,1,5]

*Output:* <span class="example-io"> [0,-1,4]

*Explanation:*

We are starting our journey from node 0, and our goal is to find the minimum time required to reach each node before it disappears.


* For node 0, we don't need any time as it is our starting point.
* For node 1, we need at least 2 units of time to traverse `edges[0]`. Unfortunately, it disappears at that moment, so we won't be able to visit it.
* For node 2, we need at least 4 units of time to traverse `edges[2]`.



<strong class="example">Example 2:*

<img 10px="" alt="" padding:="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/03/09/example2.png" style="width: 350px; height: 210px;" />

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io"> n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,1],[0,2,4]], disappear = [1,3,5]

*Output:* <span class="example-io"> [0,2,3]

*Explanation:*

We are starting our journey from node 0, and our goal is to find the minimum time required to reach each node before it disappears.


* For node 0, we don't need any time as it is the starting point.
* For node 1, we need at least 2 units of time to traverse `edges[0]`.
* For node 2, we need at least 3 units of time to traverse `edges[0]` and `edges[1]`.



<strong class="example">Example 3:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">n = 2, edges = [[0,1,1]], disappear = [1,1]

*Output:* <span class="example-io">[0,-1]

*Explanation:*

Exactly when we reach node 1, it disappears.


 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4^`
* `0 <= edges.length <= 10^5^`
* `edges[i] == [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, length<sub>i</sub>]`
* `0 <= u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub> <= n - 1`
* `1 <= length<sub>i</sub> <= 10^5^`
* `disappear.length == n`
* `1 <= disappear[i] <= 10^5^`
