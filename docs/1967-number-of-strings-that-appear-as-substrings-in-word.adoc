= 1967. Number of Strings That Appear as Substrings in Word

{leetcode}/problems/number-of-strings-that-appear-as-substrings-in-word/[LeetCode - 1967. Number of Strings That Appear as Substrings in Word ^]

Given an array of strings `patterns` and a string `word`, return _the *number* of strings in _`patterns`_ that exist as a *substring* in _`word`.

A *substring* is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* patterns = ["a","abc","bc","d"], word = "abc"
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:*
- "a" appears as a substring in "[.underline]#a#bc".
- "abc" appears as a substring in "[.underline]#abc#".
- "bc" appears as a substring in "a[.underline]#bc#".
- "d" does not appear as a substring in "abc".
3 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* patterns = ["a","b","c"], word = "aaaaabbbbb"
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:*
- "a" appears as a substring in "a[.underline]#a#aaabbbbb".
- "b" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbb[.underline]#b#".
- "c" does not appear as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
2 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* patterns = ["a","a","a"], word = "ab"
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* Each of the patterns appears as a substring in word "[.underline]#a#b".
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= patterns.length <= 100`
* `1 <= patterns[i].length <= 100`
* `1 <= word.length <= 100`
* `patterns[i]` and `word` consist of lowercase English letters.
