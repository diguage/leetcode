= 2136. Earliest Possible Day of Full Bloom

https://leetcode.com/problems/earliest-possible-day-of-full-bloom/[LeetCode - 2136. Earliest Possible Day of Full Bloom ^]

You have `n` flower seeds. Every seed must be planted first before it can begin to grow, then bloom. Planting a seed takes time and so does the growth of a seed. You are given two *0-indexed* integer arrays `plantTime` and `growTime`, of length `n` each:


* `plantTime[i]` is the number of *full days* it takes you to *plant* the `i^th^` seed. Every day, you can work on planting exactly one seed. You *do not* have to work on planting the same seed on consecutive days, but the planting of a seed is not complete *until* you have worked `plantTime[i]` days on planting it in total.
* `growTime[i]` is the number of *full days* it takes the `i^th^` seed to grow after being completely planted. *After* the last day of its growth, the flower *blooms* and stays bloomed forever.


From the beginning of day `0`, you can plant the seeds in *any* order.

Return _the *earliest* possible day where *all* seeds are blooming_.

*Input:* plantTime = [1,4,3], growTime = [2,3,1]
*Output:* 9
*Explanation:* The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.
One optimal way is:
On day 0, plant the 0^th^ seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 3.
On days 1, 2, 3, and 4, plant the 1^st^ seed. The seed grows for 3 full days and blooms on day 8.
On days 5, 6, and 7, plant the 2^nd^ seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.
Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/21/2.png" style="width: 454px; height: 184px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* plantTime = [1,2,3,2], growTime = [2,1,2,1]
*Output:* 9
*Explanation:* The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.
One optimal way is:
On day 1, plant the 0^th^ seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 4.
On days 0 and 3, plant the 1^st^ seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 5.
On days 2, 4, and 5, plant the 2^nd^ seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 8.
On days 6 and 7, plant the 3^rd^ seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.
Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* plantTime = [1], growTime = [1]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* On day 0, plant the 0^th^ seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 2.
Thus, on day 2, all the seeds are blooming.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == plantTime.length == growTime.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= plantTime[i], growTime[i] <= 10^4^`
