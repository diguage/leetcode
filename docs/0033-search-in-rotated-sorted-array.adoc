= 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/[LeetCode - Search in Rotated Sorted Array]

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return `-1`.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of _O_(log _n_).

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* nums = [`4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`, target = 0
*Output:* 4

----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* nums = [`4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`, target = 3
*Output:* -1
