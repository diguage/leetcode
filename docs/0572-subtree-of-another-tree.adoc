https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/[LeetCode - Subtree of Another Tree^]


Given two non-empty binary trees *s* and *t*, check whether tree *t* has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of *s*. A subtree of *s* is a tree consists of a node in *s* and all of this node's descendants. The tree *s* could also be considered as a subtree of itself.


*Example 1:*

Given tree s:
[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2
----
Given tree t:
[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
   4 
  / \
 1   2
----
Return *true*, because t has the same structure and node values with a subtree of s.


*Example 2:*

Given tree s:
[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2
    /
   0
----
Given tree t:
[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
   4
  / \
 1   2
----
Return *false*.
