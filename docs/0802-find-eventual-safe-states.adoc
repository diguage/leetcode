https://leetcode.com/problems/find-eventual-safe-states/[LeetCode - Find Eventual Safe States]

In a directed graph, we start at some node and every turn, walk along a directed edge of the graph.  If we reach a node that is terminal (that is, it has no outgoing directed edges), we stop.

Now, say our starting node is _eventually safe _if and only if we must eventually walk to a terminal node.  More specifically, there exists a natural number `K` so that for any choice of where to walk, we must have stopped at a terminal node in less than `K` steps.

Which nodes are eventually safe?  Return them as an array in sorted order.

The directed graph has `N` nodes with labels `0, 1, ..., N-1`, where `N` is the length of `graph`.  The graph is given in the following form: `graph[i]` is a list of labels `j` such that `(i, j)` is a directed edge of the graph.

*Example:*
*Input:* graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
*Output:* [2,4,5,6]
Here is a diagram of the above graph.

*Note:*


* `graph` will have length at most `10000`.
* The number of edges in the graph will not exceed `32000`.
* Each `graph[i]` will be a sorted list of different integers, chosen within the range `[0, graph.length - 1]`.
