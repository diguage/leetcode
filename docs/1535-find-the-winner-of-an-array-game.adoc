Given an integer array `arr` of *distinct* integers and an integer `k`.

A game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e. `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`). In each round of the game, we compare `arr[0]` with `arr[1]`, the larger integer wins and remains at position `0`, and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array. The game ends when an integer wins `k` consecutive rounds.

Return _the integer which will win the game_.

It is *guaranteed* that there will be a winner of the game.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* arr = [2,1,3,5,4,6,7], k = 2
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* Let's see the rounds of the game:
Round |       arr       | winner | win_count
  1   | [2,1,3,5,4,6,7] | 2      | 1
  2   | [2,3,5,4,6,7,1] | 3      | 1
  3   | [3,5,4,6,7,1,2] | 5      | 1
  4   | [5,4,6,7,1,2,3] | 5      | 2
So we can see that 4 rounds will be played and 5 is the winner because it wins 2 consecutive games.

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* arr = [3,2,1], k = 10
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* 3 will win the first 10 rounds consecutively.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `2 <= arr.length <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6^`
* `arr` contains *distinct* integers.
* `1 <= k <= 10^9^`
