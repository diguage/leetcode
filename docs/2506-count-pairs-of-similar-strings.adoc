= 2506. Count Pairs Of Similar Strings

{leetcode}/problems/count-pairs-of-similar-strings/[LeetCode - 2506. Count Pairs Of Similar Strings ^]

You are given a *0-indexed* string array `words`.

Two strings are *similar* if they consist of the same characters.


* For example, `"abca"` and `"cba"` are similar since both consist of characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.
* However, `"abacba"` and `"bcfd"` are not similar since they do not consist of the same characters.


Return _the number of pairs _`(i, j)`_ such that _`0 <= i < j <= word.length - 1`_ and the two strings _`words[i]`_ and _`words[j]`_ are similar_.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* words = ["aba","aabb","abcd","bac","aabc"]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* There are 2 pairs that satisfy the conditions:
- i = 0 and j = 1 : both words[0] and words[1] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'. 
- i = 3 and j = 4 : both words[3] and words[4] only consist of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. 

----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* words = ["aabb","ab","ba"]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* There are 3 pairs that satisfy the conditions:
- i = 0 and j = 1 : both words[0] and words[1] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'. 
- i = 0 and j = 2 : both words[0] and words[2] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'.
- i = 1 and j = 2 : both words[1] and words[2] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'.

----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* words = ["nba","cba","dba"]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* Since there does not exist any pair that satisfies the conditions, we return 0.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= words.length <= 100`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
* `words[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.
