= 2019. The Score of Students Solving Math Expression

https://leetcode.com/problems/the-score-of-students-solving-math-expression/[LeetCode - 2019. The Score of Students Solving Math Expression ^]

You are given a string `s` that contains digits `0-9`, addition symbols `'+'`, and multiplication symbols `'*'` *only*, representing a *valid* math expression of *single digit numbers* (e.g., `3+5*2`). This expression was given to `n` elementary school students. The students were instructed to get the answer of the expression by following this *order of operations*:


* Compute *multiplication*, reading from *left to right*; Then,
* Compute *addition*, reading from *left to right*.


You are given an integer array `answers` of length `n`, which are the submitted answers of the students in no particular order. You are asked to grade the `answers`, by following these *rules*:


* If an answer *equals* the correct answer of the expression, this student will be rewarded `5` points;
* Otherwise, if the answer *could be interpreted* as if the student applied the operators *in the wrong order* but had *correct arithmetic*, this student will be rewarded `2` points;
* Otherwise, this student will be rewarded `0` points.


Return _the sum of the points of the students_.

*Input:* s = "7+3*1*2", answers = [20,13,42]
*Output:* 7
*Explanation:* As illustrated above, the correct answer of the expression is 13, therefore one student is rewarded 5 points: [20,[.underline]#*13*#,42]
A student might have applied the operators in this wrong order: ((7+3)*1)*2 = 20. Therefore one student is rewarded 2 points: [[.underline]#*20*#,13,42]
The points for the students are: [2,5,0]. The sum of the points is 2+5+0=7.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "3+5*2", answers = [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]
*Output:* 19
*Explanation:* The correct answer of the expression is 13, therefore three students are rewarded 5 points each: [*[.underline]#13#*,0,10,*[.underline]#13#*,*[.underline]#13#*,16,16]
A student might have applied the operators in this wrong order: ((3+5)*2 = 16. Therefore two students are rewarded 2 points: [13,0,10,13,13,*[.underline]#16#*,*[.underline]#16#*]
The points for the students are: [5,0,0,5,5,2,2]. The sum of the points is 5+0+0+5+5+2+2=19.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "6+0*1", answers = [12,9,6,4,8,6]
*Output:* 10
*Explanation:* The correct answer of the expression is 6.
If a student had incorrectly done (6+0)*1, the answer would also be 6.
By the rules of grading, the students will still be rewarded 5 points (as they got the correct answer), not 2 points.
The points for the students are: [0,0,5,0,0,5]. The sum of the points is 10.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `3 <= s.length <= 31`
* `s` represents a valid expression that contains only digits `0-9`, `'+'`, and `'*'` only.
* All the integer operands in the expression are in the *inclusive* range `[0, 9]`.
* `1 <=` The count of all operators (`'+'` and `'*'`) in the math expression `<= 15`
* Test data are generated such that the correct answer of the expression is in the range of `[0, 1000]`.
* `n == answers.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^4^`
* `0 <= answers[i] <= 1000`
