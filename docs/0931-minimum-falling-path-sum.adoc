= 931. Minimum Falling Path Sum

{leetcode}/problems/minimum-falling-path-sum/[LeetCode - Minimum Falling Path Sum^]

Given a *square* array of integers `A`, we want the *minimum* sum of a _falling path_ through `A`.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row, and chooses one element from each row.  The next row's choice must be in a column that is different from the previous row's column by at most one.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
*Output:* 12
*Explanation:*
The possible falling paths are:
----


* `[1,4,7], [1,4,8], [1,5,7], [1,5,8], [1,5,9]`
* `[2,4,7], [2,4,8], [2,5,7], [2,5,8], [2,5,9], [2,6,8], [2,6,9]`
* `[3,5,7], [3,5,8], [3,5,9], [3,6,8], [3,6,9]`


The falling path with the smallest sum is `[1,4,7]`, so the answer is `12`.

 

*Note:*


* `1 <= A.length == A[0].length <= 100`
* `-100 <= A[i][j] <= 100`
