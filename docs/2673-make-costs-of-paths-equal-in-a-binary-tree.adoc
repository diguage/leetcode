= 2673. Make Costs of Paths Equal in a Binary Tree

{leetcode}/problems/make-costs-of-paths-equal-in-a-binary-tree/[LeetCode - 2673. Make Costs of Paths Equal in a Binary Tree ^]

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a *perfect binary tree* consisting of nodes numbered from `1` to `n`. The root of the tree is node `1` and each node `i` in the tree has two children where the left child is the node `2 * i` and the right child is `2 * i + 1`.

Each node in the tree also has a *cost* represented by a given *0-indexed* integer array `cost` of size `n` where `cost[i]` is the cost of node `i + 1`. You are allowed to *increment* the cost of *any* node by `1` *any* number of times.

Return _the *minimum* number of increments you need to make the cost of paths from the root to each *leaf* node equal_.

*Note*:


* A *perfect binary tree *is a tree where each node, except the leaf nodes, has exactly 2 children.
* The *cost of a path* is the sum of costs of nodes in the path.


 
*Example 1:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/04/04/binaryytreeedrawio-4.png" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 7, cost = [1,5,2,2,3,3,1]
*Output:* 6
*Explanation:* We can do the following increments:
- Increase the cost of node 4 one time.
- Increase the cost of node 3 three times.
- Increase the cost of node 7 two times.
Each path from the root to a leaf will have a total cost of 9.
The total increments we did is 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.
It can be shown that this is the minimum answer we can achieve.

*Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/04/04/binaryytreee2drawio.png" style="width: 205px; height: 151px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 3, cost = [5,3,3]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* The two paths already have equal total costs, so no increments are needed.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `3 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `n + 1` is a power of `2`
* `cost.length == n`
* `1 <= cost[i] <= 10^4^`
