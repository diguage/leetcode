= 1489. Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum Spanning Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-critical-and-pseudo-critical-edges-in-minimum-spanning-tree/[LeetCode - 1489. Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum Spanning Tree ^]

Given a weighted undirected connected graph with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, weight<sub>i</sub>]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes `a<sub>i</sub>` and `b<sub>i</sub>`. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

Find _all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST)_. An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a _critical edge_. On the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.

Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

*Input:* n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]
*Output:* [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]
*Explanation:* The figure above describes the graph.
The following figure shows all the possible MSTs:
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/04/msts.png" style="width: 540px; height: 553px;" />
Notice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.
The edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/04/ex2.png" style="width: 247px; height: 253px;" />

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,3,1]]
*Output:* [[],[0,1,2,3]]
*Explanation:* We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are pseudo-critical.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `2 <= n <= 100`
* `1 <= edges.length <= min(200, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
* `edges[i].length == 3`
* `0 <= a<sub>i</sub> < b<sub>i</sub> < n`
* `1 <= weight<sub>i</sub> <= 1000`
* All pairs `(a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>)` are *distinct*.
