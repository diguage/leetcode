= 1840. Maximum Building Height

{leetcode}/problems/maximum-building-height/[LeetCode - 1840. Maximum Building Height ^]

You want to build `n` new buildings in a city. The new buildings will be built in a line and are labeled from `1` to `n`.

However, there are city restrictions on the heights of the new buildings:


* The height of each building must be a non-negative integer.
* The height of the first building *must* be `0`.
* The height difference between any two adjacent buildings *cannot exceed* `1`.


Additionally, there are city restrictions on the maximum height of specific buildings. These restrictions are given as a 2D integer array `restrictions` where `restrictions[i] = [id<sub>i</sub>, maxHeight<sub>i</sub>]` indicates that building `id<sub>i</sub>` must have a height *less than or equal to* `maxHeight<sub>i</sub>`.

It is guaranteed that each building will appear *at most once* in `restrictions`, and building `1` will *not* be in `restrictions`.

Return _the *maximum possible height* of the *tallest* building_.

 
*Example 1:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/ic236-q4-ex1-1.png" style="width: 400px; height: 253px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 5, restrictions = [[2,1],[4,1]]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.
We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,1,2], and the tallest building has a height of 2.
----

*Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/ic236-q4-ex2.png" style="width: 500px; height: 269px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 6, restrictions = []
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.
We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,3,4,5], and the tallest building has a height of 5.

----

*Example 3:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/ic236-q4-ex3.png" style="width: 500px; height: 187px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 10, restrictions = [[5,3],[2,5],[7,4],[10,3]]
*Output:* 5
*Explanation:* The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.
We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,3,3,4,4,5,4,3], and the tallest building has a height of 5.

----

 
*Constraints:*


* `2 <= n <= 10^9^`
* `0 <= restrictions.length <= min(n - 1, 10^5^)`
* `2 <= id<sub>i</sub> <= n`
* `id<sub>i</sub>` is *unique*.
* `0 <= maxHeight<sub>i</sub> <= 10^9^`
