= 2068. Check Whether Two Strings are Almost Equivalent

https://leetcode.com/problems/check-whether-two-strings-are-almost-equivalent/[LeetCode - 2068. Check Whether Two Strings are Almost Equivalent ^]

Two strings `word1` and `word2` are considered *almost equivalent* if the differences between the frequencies of each letter from `'a'` to `'z'` between `word1` and `word2` is *at most* `3`.

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, each of length `n`, return `true` _if _`word1` _and_ `word2` _are *almost equivalent*, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

The *frequency* of a letter `x` is the number of times it occurs in the string.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* word1 = "aaaa", word2 = "bccb"
*Output:* false
*Explanation:* There are 4 'a's in "aaaa" but 0 'a's in "bccb".
The difference is 4, which is more than the allowed 3.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* word1 = "abcdeef", word2 = "abaaacc"
*Output:* true
*Explanation:* The differences between the frequencies of each letter in word1 and word2 are at most 3:
- 'a' appears 1 time in word1 and 4 times in word2. The difference is 3.
- 'b' appears 1 time in word1 and 1 time in word2. The difference is 0.
- 'c' appears 1 time in word1 and 2 times in word2. The difference is 1.
- 'd' appears 1 time in word1 and 0 times in word2. The difference is 1.
- 'e' appears 2 times in word1 and 0 times in word2. The difference is 2.
- 'f' appears 1 time in word1 and 0 times in word2. The difference is 1.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* word1 = "cccddabba", word2 = "babababab"
*Output:* true
*Explanation:* The differences between the frequencies of each letter in word1 and word2 are at most 3:
- 'a' appears 2 times in word1 and 4 times in word2. The difference is 2.
- 'b' appears 2 times in word1 and 5 times in word2. The difference is 3.
- 'c' appears 3 times in word1 and 0 times in word2. The difference is 3.
- 'd' appears 2 times in word1 and 0 times in word2. The difference is 2.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == word1.length == word2.length`
* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `word1` and `word2` consist only of lowercase English letters.
