= 2594. Minimum Time to Repair Cars

{leetcode}/problems/minimum-time-to-repair-cars/[LeetCode - 2594. Minimum Time to Repair Cars ^]

You are given an integer array `ranks` representing the *ranks* of some mechanics. <font face="monospace">ranks<sub>i</sub> is the rank of the <font face="monospace">i^th^ mechanic<font face="monospace">. A mechanic with a rank `r` can repair <font face="monospace">n cars in `r * n^2^` minutes.

You are also given an integer `cars` representing the total number of cars waiting in the garage to be repaired.

Return _the *minimum* time taken to repair all the cars._

*Note:* All the mechanics can repair the cars simultaneously.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* ranks = [4,2,3,1], cars = 10
*Output:* 16
*Explanation:* 
- The first mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 4 * 2 * 2 = 16 minutes.
- The second mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 minutes.
- The third mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 minutes.
- The fourth mechanic will repair four cars. The time required is 1 * 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
It can be proved that the cars cannot be repaired in less than 16 minutes.​​​​​
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* ranks = [5,1,8], cars = 6
*Output:* 16
*Explanation:* 
- The first mechanic will repair one car. The time required is 5 * 1 * 1 = 5 minutes.
- The second mechanic will repair four cars. The time required is 1 * 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
- The third mechanic will repair one car. The time required is 8 * 1 * 1 = 8 minutes.
It can be proved that the cars cannot be repaired in less than 16 minutes.​​​​​
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= ranks.length <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= ranks[i] <= 100`
* `1 <= cars <= 10^6^`
