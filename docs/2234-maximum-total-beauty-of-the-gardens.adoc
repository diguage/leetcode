= 2234. Maximum Total Beauty of the Gardens

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-total-beauty-of-the-gardens/[LeetCode - 2234. Maximum Total Beauty of the Gardens ^]

Alice is a caretaker of `n` gardens and she wants to plant flowers to maximize the total beauty of all her gardens.

You are given a *0-indexed* integer array `flowers` of size `n`, where `flowers[i]` is the number of flowers already planted in the `i^th^` garden. Flowers that are already planted *cannot* be removed. You are then given another integer `newFlowers`, which is the *maximum* number of flowers that Alice can additionally plant. You are also given the integers `target`, `full`, and `partial`.

A garden is considered *complete* if it has *at least* `target` flowers. The *total beauty* of the gardens is then determined as the *sum* of the following:


* The number of *complete* gardens multiplied by `full`.
* The *minimum* number of flowers in any of the *incomplete* gardens multiplied by `partial`. If there are no incomplete gardens, then this value will be `0`.


Return _the *maximum* total beauty that Alice can obtain after planting at most _`newFlowers`_ flowers._

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* flowers = [1,3,1,1], newFlowers = 7, target = 6, full = 12, partial = 1
*Output:* 14
*Explanation:* Alice can plant
- 2 flowers in the 0^th^ garden
- 3 flowers in the 1^st^ garden
- 1 flower in the 2^nd^ garden
- 1 flower in the 3^rd^ garden
The gardens will then be [3,6,2,2]. She planted a total of 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 7 flowers.
There is 1 garden that is complete.
The minimum number of flowers in the incomplete gardens is 2.
Thus, the total beauty is 1 * 12 + 2 * 1 = 12 + 2 = 14.
No other way of planting flowers can obtain a total beauty higher than 14.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* flowers = [2,4,5,3], newFlowers = 10, target = 5, full = 2, partial = 6
*Output:* 30
*Explanation:* Alice can plant
- 3 flowers in the 0^th^ garden
- 0 flowers in the 1^st^ garden
- 0 flowers in the 2^nd^ garden
- 2 flowers in the 3^rd^ garden
The gardens will then be [5,4,5,5]. She planted a total of 3 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 5 flowers.
There are 3 gardens that are complete.
The minimum number of flowers in the incomplete gardens is 4.
Thus, the total beauty is 3 * 2 + 4 * 6 = 6 + 24 = 30.
No other way of planting flowers can obtain a total beauty higher than 30.
Note that Alice could make all the gardens complete but in this case, she would obtain a lower total beauty.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= flowers.length <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= flowers[i], target <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= newFlowers <= 10^10^`
* `1 <= full, partial <= 10^5^`
