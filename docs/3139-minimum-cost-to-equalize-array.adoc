= 3139. Minimum Cost to Equalize Array

{leetcode}/problems/minimum-cost-to-equalize-array/[LeetCode - 3139. Minimum Cost to Equalize Array ^]

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `cost1` and `cost2`. You are allowed to perform *either* of the following operations *any* number of times:


* Choose an index `i` from `nums` and *increase* `nums[i]` by `1` for a cost of `cost1`.
* Choose two *different* indices `i`, `j`, from `nums` and *increase* `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` by `1` for a cost of `cost2`.


Return the *minimum* *cost* required to make all elements in the array *equal*_. _

Since the answer may be very large, return it *modulo* `10^9^ + 7`.

 
*Example 1:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">nums = [4,1], cost1 = 5, cost2 = 2

*Output:* <span class="example-io">15

*Explanation: *

The following operations can be performed to make the values equal:


* Increase `nums[1]` by 1 for a cost of 5. `nums` becomes `[4,2]`.
* Increase `nums[1]` by 1 for a cost of 5. `nums` becomes `[4,3]`.
* Increase `nums[1]` by 1 for a cost of 5. `nums` becomes `[4,4]`.


The total cost is 15.


*Example 2:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">nums = [2,3,3,3,5], cost1 = 2, cost2 = 1

*Output:* <span class="example-io">6

*Explanation: *

The following operations can be performed to make the values equal:


* Increase `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` by 1 for a cost of 1. `nums` becomes `[3,4,3,3,5]`.
* Increase `nums[0]` and `nums[2]` by 1 for a cost of 1. `nums` becomes `[4,4,4,3,5]`.
* Increase `nums[0]` and `nums[3]` by 1 for a cost of 1. `nums` becomes `[5,4,4,4,5]`.
* Increase `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` by 1 for a cost of 1. `nums` becomes `[5,5,5,4,5]`.
* Increase `nums[3]` by 1 for a cost of 2. `nums` becomes `[5,5,5,5,5]`.


The total cost is 6.


*Example 3:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">nums = [3,5,3], cost1 = 1, cost2 = 3

*Output:* <span class="example-io">4

*Explanation:*

The following operations can be performed to make the values equal:


* Increase `nums[0]` by 1 for a cost of 1. `nums` becomes `[4,5,3]`.
* Increase `nums[0]` by 1 for a cost of 1. `nums` becomes `[5,5,3]`.
* Increase `nums[2]` by 1 for a cost of 1. `nums` becomes `[5,5,4]`.
* Increase `nums[2]` by 1 for a cost of 1. `nums` becomes `[5,5,5]`.


The total cost is 4.


 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6^`
* `1 <= cost1 <= 10^6^`
* `1 <= cost2 <= 10^6^`
