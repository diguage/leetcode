= 420. Strong Password Checker

https://leetcode.com/problems/strong-password-checker/[LeetCode - Strong Password Checker]

A password is considered strong if below conditions are all met:


.  It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters. 
.  It must contain at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit. 
.  It must NOT contain three repeating characters in a row ("...aaa..." is weak, but "...aa...a..." is strong, assuming other conditions are met). 


Write a function strongPasswordChecker(s), that takes a string s as input, and return the *MINIMUM* change required to make s a strong password. If s is already strong, return 0.

Insertion, deletion or replace of any one character are all considered as one change.
