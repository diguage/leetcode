= 2509. Cycle Length Queries in a Tree

{leetcode}/problems/cycle-length-queries-in-a-tree/[LeetCode - 2509. Cycle Length Queries in a Tree ^]

You are given an integer `n`. There is a *complete binary tree* with `2^n^ - 1` nodes. The root of that tree is the node with the value `1`, and every node with a value `val` in the range `[1, 2^n - 1^ - 1]` has two children where:


* The left node has the value `2 * val`, and
* The right node has the value `2 * val + 1`.


You are also given a 2D integer array `queries` of length `m`, where `queries[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]`. For each query, solve the following problem:


* Add an edge between the nodes with values `a<sub>i</sub>` and `b<sub>i</sub>`.
* Find the length of the cycle in the graph.
* Remove the added edge between nodes with values `a<sub>i</sub>` and `b<sub>i</sub>`.


*Note* that:


* A *cycle* is a path that starts and ends at the same node, and each edge in the path is visited only once.
* The length of a cycle is the number of edges visited in the cycle.
* There could be multiple edges between two nodes in the tree after adding the edge of the query.


Return _an array _`answer`_ of length _`m`_ where_ `answer[i]` _is the answer to the_ `i^th^` _query._

*Input:* n = 3, queries = [[5,3],[4,7],[2,3]]
*Output:* [4,5,3]
*Explanation:* The diagrams above show the tree of 2^3^ - 1 nodes. Nodes colored in red describe the nodes in the cycle after adding the edge.
- After adding the edge between nodes 3 and 5, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [5,2,1,3]. Thus answer to the first query is 4. We delete the added edge and process the next query.
- After adding the edge between nodes 4 and 7, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [4,2,1,3,7]. Thus answer to the second query is 5. We delete the added edge and process the next query.
- After adding the edge between nodes 2 and 3, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [2,1,3]. Thus answer to the third query is 3. We delete the added edge.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 2, queries = [[1,2]]
*Output:* [2]
*Explanation:* The diagram above shows the tree of 2^2^ - 1 nodes. Nodes colored in red describe the nodes in the cycle after adding the edge.
- After adding the edge between nodes 1 and 2, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [2,1]. Thus answer for the first query is 2. We delete the added edge.

*Constraints:*


* `2 <= n <= 30`
* `m == queries.length`
* `1 <= m <= 10^5^`
* `queries[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> <= 2^n^ - 1`
* `a<sub>i</sub> != b<sub>i</sub>`
