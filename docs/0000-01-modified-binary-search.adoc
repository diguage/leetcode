= Modified Binary Search 改进的二分搜索

image::images/modified-binary-search.jpeg[{image_attr}]

当你需要解决的问题的输入是排好序的数组，链表，或是排好序的矩阵，要求咱们寻找某些特定元素。这个时候的不二选择就是二分搜索。这种模式是一种超级牛的用二分来解决问题的方式。

对于一组满足上升排列的数集来说，这种模式的步骤是这样的：

. 首先，算出左右端点的中点。最简单的方式是这样的： latexmath:[middle = (start + end) / 2]。但这种计算方式有不小的概率会出现整数越界。因此一般都推荐另外这种写法： latexmath:[middle = start + (end - start) / 2].
. 如果要找的目标改好和中点所在的数值相等，我们返回中点的下标就行
. 如果目标不等的话：我们就有两种移动方式了如果目标比中点在的值小（key < arr[middle]）：将下一步搜索空间放到左边（end = middle - 1）
. 如果比中点的值大，则继续在右边搜索，丢弃左边：left = middle + 1

看到**#最大化最小值#**或者**#最小化最大值#**就要想到二分答案，这是一个固定的套路。

== 疑问点

. 二分搜索怎样可以确定地取左右端点？
. 在 https://leetcode.cn/problems/search-insert-position/solutions/2023391/er-fen-cha-zhao-zong-shi-xie-bu-dui-yi-g-nq23/[35. 搜索插入位置 - 二分查找总是写不对？一个视频讲透！^] 中，作者说“在找到 target 就立刻返回”，这种写法适用范围很窄，多思考体会一下。
