= 497. Random Point in Non-overlapping Rectangles

https://leetcode.com/problems/random-point-in-non-overlapping-rectangles/[LeetCode - Random Point in Non-overlapping Rectangles]

Given a list of *non-overlapping* axis-aligned rectangles `rects`, write a function `pick` which randomly and uniformily picks an *integer point* in the space covered by the rectangles.

Note:


. An *integer point* is a point that has integer coordinates. 
. A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is *included* in the space covered by the rectangles. 
. `i`th rectangle = `rects[i]` = `[x1,y1,x2,y2]`, where `[x1, y1]` are the integer coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and `[x2, y2]` are the integer coordinates of the top-right corner.
. length and width of each rectangle does not exceed `2000`.
. `1 <= rects.length <= 100`
. `pick` return a point as an array of integer coordinates `[p_x, p_y]`
. `pick` is called at most `10000` times.



*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*
 ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
 [[[[1,1,5,5]]],[],[],[]]
*Output:* [null,[4,1],[4,1],[3,3]]
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:*
 ["Solution","pick","pick","pick","pick","pick"]
 [[[[-2,-2,-1,-1],[1,0,3,0]]],[],[],[],[],[]]
*Output:*
 [null,[-1,-2],[2,0],[-2,-1],[3,0],[-2,-2]]
----



*Explanation of Input Syntax:*

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. `Solution`'s constructor has one argument, the array of rectangles `rects`. `pick` has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.
