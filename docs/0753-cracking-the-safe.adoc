There is a box protected by a password. The password is a sequence of `n` digits where each digit can be one of the first `k` digits `0, 1, ..., k-1`.

While entering a password, the last `n` digits entered will automatically be matched against the correct password.

For example, assuming the correct password is `"345"`, if you type `"012345"`, the box will open because the correct password matches the suffix of the entered password.

Return any password of *minimum length* that is guaranteed to open the box at some point of entering it.

 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 1, k = 2
*Output:* "01"
*Note:* "10" will be accepted too.
----

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 2, k = 2
*Output:* "00110"
*Note:* "01100", "10011", "11001" will be accepted too.
----

 

*Note:*


. `n` will be in the range `[1, 4]`.
. `k` will be in the range `[1, 10]`.
. `k^n` will be at most `4096`.
