== 1039. Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-score-triangulation-of-polygon/[LeetCode - Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon]

Given `N`, consider a convex `N`-sided polygon with vertices labelled `A[0], A[i], ..., A[N-1]` in clockwise order.

Suppose you triangulate the polygon into `N-2` triangles.  For each triangle, the value of that triangle is the *product* of the labels of the vertices, and the _total score_ of the triangulation is the sum of these values over all `N-2` triangles in the triangulation.

Return the smallest possible total score that you can achieve with some triangulation of the polygon.

----
*Input: *<span id="example-input-1-1">[1,2,3]
*Output: *<span id="example-output-1">6
*Explanation: *The polygon is already triangulated, and the score of the only triangle is 6.

----
*Input: *<span id="example-input-2-1">[3,7,4,5]
*Output: *<span id="example-output-2">144
*Explanation: *There are two triangulations, with possible scores: 3*7*5 + 4*5*7 = 245, or 3*4*5 + 3*4*7 = 144.  The minimum score is 144.

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input: *<span id="example-input-3-1">[1,3,1,4,1,5]
*Output: *<span id="example-output-3">13
*Explanation: *The minimum score triangulation has score 1*1*3 + 1*1*4 + 1*1*5 + 1*1*1 = 13.

*Note:*


. `3 <= A.length <= 50`
. `1 <= A[i] <= 100`
