= 872. Leaf-Similar Trees

https://leetcode.com/problems/leaf-similar-trees/[LeetCode - Leaf-Similar Trees]

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a _leaf value sequence._

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is `(6, 7, 4, 9, 8)`.

Two binary trees are considered _leaf-similar_ if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return `true` if and only if the two given trees with head nodes `root1` and `root2` are leaf-similar.

 

*Note:*


* Both of the given trees will have between `1` and `100` nodes.
