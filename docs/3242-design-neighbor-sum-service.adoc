= 3242. Design Neighbor Sum Service

https://leetcode.com/problems/design-neighbor-sum-service/[LeetCode - 3242. Design Neighbor Sum Service ^]

You are given a `n x n` 2D array `grid` containing *distinct* elements in the range `[0, n^2^ - 1]`.

Implement the `NeighborSum` class:


* `NeighborSum(int [][]grid)` initializes the object.
* `int adjacentSum(int value)` returns the *sum* of elements which are adjacent neighbors of `value`, that is either to the top, left, right, or bottom of `value` in `grid`.
* `int diagonalSum(int value)` returns the *sum* of elements which are diagonal neighbors of `value`, that is either to the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right of `value` in `grid`.

<strong class="example"><img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/24/designexample0.png" style="width: 250px; height: 249px;" />*


* The adjacent neighbors of 1 are 0, 2, and 4.
* The adjacent neighbors of 4 are 1, 3, 5, and 7.
* The diagonal neighbors of 4 are 0, 2, 6, and 8.
* The diagonal neighbor of 8 is 4.



<strong class="example">Example 2:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:*

["NeighborSum", "adjacentSum", "diagonalSum"]

[[[[1, 2, 0, 3], [4, 7, 15, 6], [8, 9, 10, 11], [12, 13, 14, 5]]], [15], [9]]

*Output:* [null, 23, 45]

*Explanation:*

<strong class="example"><img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/24/designexample2.png" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;" />*


* The adjacent neighbors of 15 are 0, 10, 7, and 6.
* The diagonal neighbors of 9 are 4, 12, 14, and 15.



 
*Constraints:*


* `3 <= n == grid.length == grid[0].length <= 10`
* `0 <= grid[i][j] <= n^2^ - 1`
* All `grid[i][j]` are distinct.
* `value` in `adjacentSum` and `diagonalSum` will be in the range `[0, n^2^ - 1]`.
* At most `2 * n^2^` calls will be made to `adjacentSum` and `diagonalSum`.
