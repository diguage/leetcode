= 2791. Count Paths That Can Form a Palindrome in a Tree

{leetcode}/problems/count-paths-that-can-form-a-palindrome-in-a-tree/[LeetCode - 2791. Count Paths That Can Form a Palindrome in a Tree ^]

You are given a *tree* (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) *rooted* at node `0` consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The tree is represented by a *0-indexed* array `parent` of size `n`, where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node `0` is the root, `parent[0] == -1`.

You are also given a string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i]` is the character assigned to the edge between `i` and `parent[i]`. `s[0]` can be ignored.

Return _the number of pairs of nodes _`(u, v)`_ such that _`u < v`_ and the characters assigned to edges on the path from _`u`_ to _`v`_ can be *rearranged* to form a *palindrome*_.

A string is a *palindrome* when it reads the same backwards as forwards.

 
*Example 1:*

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/07/15/treedrawio-8drawio.png" style="width: 281px; height: 181px;" />

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* parent = [-1,0,0,1,1,2], s = "acaabc"
*Output:* 8
*Explanation:* The valid pairs are:
- All the pairs (0,1), (0,2), (1,3), (1,4) and (2,5) result in one character which is always a palindrome.
- The pair (2,3) result in the string "aca" which is a palindrome.
- The pair (1,5) result in the string "cac" which is a palindrome.
- The pair (3,5) result in the string "acac" which can be rearranged into the palindrome "acca".

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* parent = [-1,0,0,0,0], s = "aaaaa"
*Output:* 10
*Explanation:* Any pair of nodes (u,v) where u < v is valid.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == parent.length == s.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `0 <= parent[i] <= n - 1` for all `i >= 1`
* `parent[0] == -1`
* `parent` represents a valid tree.
* `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
