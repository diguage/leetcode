{leetcode}/problems/type-of-triangle/[LeetCode - 3024. Type of Triangle ^]

You are given a *0-indexed* integer array `nums` of size `3` which can form the sides of a triangle.


* A triangle is called *equilateral* if it has all sides of equal length.
* A triangle is called *isosceles* if it has exactly two sides of equal length.
* A triangle is called *scalene* if all its sides are of different lengths.


Return _a string representing_ _the type of triangle that can be formed __or _`"none"`_ if it *cannot* form a triangle._

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [3,3,3]
*Output:* "equilateral"
*Explanation:* Since all the sides are of equal length, therefore, it will form an equilateral triangle.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [3,4,5]
*Output:* "scalene"
*Explanation:* 
nums[0] + nums[1] = 3 + 4 = 7, which is greater than nums[2] = 5.
nums[0] + nums[2] = 3 + 5 = 8, which is greater than nums[1] = 4.
nums[1] + nums[2] = 4 + 5 = 9, which is greater than nums[0] = 3. 
Since the sum of the two sides is greater than the third side for all three cases, therefore, it can form a triangle.
As all the sides are of different lengths, it will form a scalene triangle.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `nums.length == 3`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
