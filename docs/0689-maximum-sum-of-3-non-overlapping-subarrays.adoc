= 689. Maximum Sum of 3 Non-Overlapping Subarrays

{leetcode}/problems/maximum-sum-of-3-non-overlapping-subarrays/[LeetCode - Maximum Sum of 3 Non-Overlapping Subarrays^]

In a given array `nums` of positive integers, find three non-overlapping subarrays with maximum sum.

Each subarray will be of size `k`, and we want to maximize the sum of all `3*k` entries.

Return the result as a list of indices representing the starting position of each interval (0-indexed). If there are multiple answers, return the lexicographically smallest one.

*Example:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* [1,2,1,2,6,7,5,1], 2
*Output:* [0, 3, 5]
*Explanation:* Subarrays [1, 2], [2, 6], [7, 5] correspond to the starting indices [0, 3, 5].
We could have also taken [2, 1], but an answer of [1, 3, 5] would be lexicographically larger.
----

 

*Note:*


* `nums.length` will be between 1 and 20000.
* `nums[i]` will be between 1 and 65535.
* `k` will be between 1 and floor(nums.length / 3).
