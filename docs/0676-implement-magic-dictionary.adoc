https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-magic-dictionary/[LeetCode - Implement Magic Dictionary]


Implement a magic directory with `buildDict`, and `search` methods.



For the method `buildDict`, you'll be given a list of non-repetitive words to build a dictionary.



For the method `search`, you'll be given a word, and judge whether if you modify *exactly* one character into *another* character in this word, the modified word is in the dictionary you just built.


*Example 1:*


[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
Input: buildDict(["hello", "leetcode"]), Output: Null
Input: search("hello"), Output: False
Input: search("hhllo"), Output: True
Input: search("hell"), Output: False
Input: search("leetcoded"), Output: False
----


*Note:*

. You may assume that all the inputs are consist of lowercase letters `a-z`.
. For contest purpose, the test data is rather small by now. You could think about highly efficient algorithm after the contest.
. Please remember to *RESET* your class variables declared in class MagicDictionary, as static/class variables are *persisted across multiple test cases*. Please see <a href="https://leetcode.com/faq/#different-output">here</a> for more details.
