= 2846. Minimum Edge Weight Equilibrium Queries in a Tree

{leetcode}/problems/minimum-edge-weight-equilibrium-queries-in-a-tree/[LeetCode - 2846. Minimum Edge Weight Equilibrium Queries in a Tree ^]

There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given the integer `n` and a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `u<sub>i</sub>` and `v<sub>i</sub>` with weight `w<sub>i</sub>` in the tree.

You are also given a 2D integer array `queries` of length `m`, where `queries[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]`. For each query, find the *minimum number of operations* required to make the weight of every edge on the path from `a<sub>i</sub>` to `b<sub>i</sub>` equal. In one operation, you can choose any edge of the tree and change its weight to any value.

*Note* that:


* Queries are *independent* of each other, meaning that the tree returns to its *initial state* on each new query.
* The path from `a<sub>i</sub>` to `b<sub>i</sub>` is a sequence of *distinct* nodes starting with node `a<sub>i</sub>` and ending with node `b<sub>i</sub>` such that every two adjacent nodes in the sequence share an edge in the tree.


Return _an array _`answer`_ of length _`m`_ where_ `answer[i]` _is the answer to the_ `i^th^` _query._

*Input:* n = 7, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,2],[4,5,2],[5,6,2]], queries = [[0,3],[3,6],[2,6],[0,6]]
*Output:* [0,0,1,3]
*Explanation:* In the first query, all the edges in the path from 0 to 3 have a weight of 1. Hence, the answer is 0.
In the second query, all the edges in the path from 3 to 6 have a weight of 2. Hence, the answer is 0.
In the third query, we change the weight of edge [2,3] to 2. After this operation, all the edges in the path from 2 to 6 have a weight of 2. Hence, the answer is 1.
In the fourth query, we change the weights of edges [0,1], [1,2] and [2,3] to 2. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 0 to 6 have a weight of 2. Hence, the answer is 3.
For each queries[i], it can be shown that answer[i] is the minimum number of operations needed to equalize all the edge weights in the path from a<sub>i</sub> to b<sub>i</sub>.

*Input:* n = 8, edges = [[1,2,6],[1,3,4],[2,4,6],[2,5,3],[3,6,6],[3,0,8],[7,0,2]], queries = [[4,6],[0,4],[6,5],[7,4]]
*Output:* [1,2,2,3]
*Explanation:* In the first query, we change the weight of edge [1,3] to 6. After this operation, all the edges in the path from 4 to 6 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 1.
In the second query, we change the weight of edges [0,3] and [3,1] to 6. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 0 to 4 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 2.
In the third query, we change the weight of edges [1,3] and [5,2] to 6. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 6 to 5 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 2.
In the fourth query, we change the weights of edges [0,7], [0,3] and [1,3] to 6. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 7 to 4 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 3.
For each queries[i], it can be shown that answer[i] is the minimum number of operations needed to equalize all the edge weights in the path from a<sub>i</sub> to b<sub>i</sub>.

*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 10^4^`
* `edges.length == n - 1`
* `edges[i].length == 3`
* `0 <= u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub> < n`
* `1 <= w<sub>i</sub> <= 26`
* The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
* `1 <= queries.length == m <= 2 * 10^4^`
* `queries[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> < n`
