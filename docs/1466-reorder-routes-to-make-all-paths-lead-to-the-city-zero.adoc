There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.

Roads are represented by `connections` where `connections[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]` represents a road from city `a<sub>i</sub>` to city `b<sub>i</sub>`.

This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city `0`), and many people want to travel to this city.

Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city `0`. Return the *minimum* number of edges changed.

It's *guaranteed* that each city can reach city `0` after reorder.

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation: *Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).
----

*Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/13/sample_2_1819.png" style="width: 509px; height: 79px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 5, connections = [[1,0],[1,2],[3,2],[3,4]]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation: *Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 3, connections = [[1,0],[2,0]]
*Output:* 0
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4^`
* `connections.length == n - 1`
* `connections[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> <= n - 1`
* `a<sub>i</sub> != b<sub>i</sub>`
