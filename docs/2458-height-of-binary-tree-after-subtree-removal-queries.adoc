= 2458. Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries

https://leetcode.com/problems/height-of-binary-tree-after-subtree-removal-queries/[LeetCode - 2458. Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries ^]

You are given the `root` of a *binary tree* with `n` nodes. Each node is assigned a unique value from `1` to `n`. You are also given an array `queries` of size `m`.

You have to perform `m` *independent* queries on the tree where in the `i^th^` query you do the following:


* *Remove* the subtree rooted at the node with the value `queries[i]` from the tree. It is *guaranteed* that `queries[i]` will *not* be equal to the value of the root.


Return _an array _`answer`_ of size _`m`_ where _`answer[i]`_ is the height of the tree after performing the _`i^th^`_ query_.

*Note*:


* The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its *initial* state after each query.
* The height of a tree is the *number of edges in the longest simple path* from the root to some node in the tree.


 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/07/binaryytreeedrawio-1.png" style="width: 495px; height: 281px;" />

*Input:* root = [1,3,4,2,null,6,5,null,null,null,null,null,7], queries = [4]
*Output:* [2]
*Explanation:* The diagram above shows the tree after removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4.
The height of the tree is 2 (The path 1 -> 3 -> 2).

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/07/binaryytreeedrawio-2.png" style="width: 301px; height: 284px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* root = [5,8,9,2,1,3,7,4,6], queries = [3,2,4,8]
*Output:* [3,2,3,2]
*Explanation:* We have the following queries:
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 3. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 2. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 1).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 8. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 9 -> 3).
----

 
*Constraints:*


* The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
* `2 <= n <= 10^5^`
* `1 <= Node.val <= n`
* All the values in the tree are *unique*.
* `m == queries.length`
* `1 <= m <= min(n, 10^4^)`
* `1 <= queries[i] <= n`
* `queries[i] != root.val`
