https://leetcode.com/problems/dice-roll-simulation/[LeetCode - Dice Roll Simulation^]

A die simulator generates a random number from 1 to 6 for each roll. You introduced a constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number `i` more than `rollMax[i]` (1-indexed) *consecutive* times. 

Given an array of integers `rollMax` and an integer `n`, return the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact `n` rolls.

Two sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

 
*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
*Output:* 34
*Explanation:* There will be 2 rolls of die, if there are no constraints on the die, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible combinations. In this case, looking at rollMax array, the numbers 1 and 2 appear at most once consecutively, therefore sequences (1,1) and (2,2) cannot occur, so the final answer is 36-2 = 34.

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,1,1,1,1]
*Output:* 30
----

*Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* n = 3, rollMax = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
*Output:* 181
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n <= 5000`
* `rollMax.length == 6`
* `1 <= rollMax[i] <= 15`
