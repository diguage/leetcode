= 919. Complete Binary Tree Inserter

https://leetcode.com/problems/complete-binary-tree-inserter/[LeetCode - Complete Binary Tree Inserter^]

A _complete_ binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

Write a data structure `CBTInserter` that is initialized with a complete binary tree and supports the following operations:


* `CBTInserter(TreeNode root)` initializes the data structure on a given tree with head node `root`;
* `CBTInserter.insert(int v)` will insert a `TreeNode` into the tree with value `node.val = v` so that the tree remains complete, *and returns the value of the parent of the inserted `TreeNode`*;
* `CBTInserter.get_root()` will return the head node of the tree.






 

*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* inputs = ["CBTInserter","insert","get_root"], inputs = [[[1]],[2],[]]
*Output:* [null,1,[1,2]]
----


*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* inputs = ["CBTInserter","insert","insert","get_root"], inputs = [[[1,2,3,4,5,6]],[7],[8],[]]
*Output:* [null,3,4,[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]]
----



 

*Note:*


* The initial given tree is complete and contains between `1` and `1000` nodes.
* `CBTInserter.insert` is called at most `10000` times per test case.
* Every value of a given or inserted node is between `0` and `5000`.
