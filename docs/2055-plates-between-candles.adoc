{leetcode}/problems/plates-between-candles/[LeetCode - 2055. Plates Between Candles ^]

There is a long table with a line of plates and candles arranged on top of it. You are given a *0-indexed* string `s` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'|'` only, where a `'*'` represents a *plate* and a `'|'` represents a *candle*.

You are also given a *0-indexed* 2D integer array `queries` where `queries[i] = [left<sub>i</sub>, right<sub>i</sub>]` denotes the *substring* `s[left<sub>i</sub>...right<sub>i</sub>]` (*inclusive*). For each query, you need to find the *number* of plates *between candles* that are *in the substring*. A plate is considered *between candles* if there is at least one candle to its left *and* at least one candle to its right *in the substring*.


* For example, `s = "||**||**|*"`, and a query `[3, 8]` denotes the substring `"*||*[.underline]#**#*|"`. The number of plates between candles in this substring is `2`, as each of the two plates has at least one candle *in the substring* to its left *and* right.


Return _an integer array_ `answer` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the answer to the_ `i^th^` _query_.

*Input:* s = "**|**|***|", queries = [[2,5],[5,9]]
*Output:* [2,3]
*Explanation:*
- queries[0] has two plates between candles.
- queries[1] has three plates between candles.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
<img alt="ex-2" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/04/ex-2.png" style="width: 600px; height: 193px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* s = "***|**|*****|**||**|*", queries = [[1,17],[4,5],[14,17],[5,11],[15,16]]
*Output:* [9,0,0,0,0]
*Explanation:*
- queries[0] has nine plates between candles.
- The other queries have zero plates between candles.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `3 <= s.length <= 10^5^`
* `s` consists of `'*'` and `'|'` characters.
* `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5^`
* `queries[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= left<sub>i</sub> <= right<sub>i</sub> < s.length`
