= 1761. Minimum Degree of a Connected Trio in a Graph

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-degree-of-a-connected-trio-in-a-graph/[LeetCode - 1761. Minimum Degree of a Connected Trio in a Graph ^]

You are given an undirected graph. You are given an integer `n` which is the number of nodes in the graph and an array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between `u<sub>i</sub>` and `v<sub>i</sub>`.

A *connected trio* is a set of *three* nodes where there is an edge between *every* pair of them.

The *degree of a connected trio* is the number of edges where one endpoint is in the trio, and the other is not.

Return _the *minimum* degree of a connected trio in the graph, or_ `-1` _if the graph has no connected trios._

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 6, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[3,2],[4,1],[5,2],[3,6]]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:* There is exactly one trio, which is [1,2,3]. The edges that form its degree are bolded in the figure above.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/26/trios2.png" style="width: 388px; height: 164px;" />
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* n = 7, edges = [[1,3],[4,1],[4,3],[2,5],[5,6],[6,7],[7,5],[2,6]]
*Output:* 0
*Explanation:* There are exactly three trios:
1) [1,4,3] with degree 0.
2) [2,5,6] with degree 2.
3) [5,6,7] with degree 2.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `2 <= n <= 400`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= edges.length <= n * (n-1) / 2`
* `1 <= u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub> <= n`
* `u<sub>i </sub>!= v<sub>i</sub>`
* There are no repeated edges.
