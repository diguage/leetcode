= 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/[LeetCode - Diameter of Binary Tree]

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the *longest* path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

.Example:
----
Given a binary tree
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
----

*Note:* The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

== 解题分析

这道题就是一个深度优先搜索。不同之处在于，要在遍历过程中，把直径的最大值保存下来。同时，还要返回子树中最长的路径。
