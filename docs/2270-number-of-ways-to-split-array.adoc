= 2270. Number of Ways to Split Array

{leetcode}/problems/number-of-ways-to-split-array/[LeetCode - 2270. Number of Ways to Split Array ^]

You are given a *0-indexed* integer array `nums` of length `n`.

`nums` contains a *valid split* at index `i` if the following are true:


* The sum of the first `i + 1` elements is *greater than or equal to* the sum of the last `n - i - 1` elements.
* There is *at least one* element to the right of `i`. That is, `0 <= i < n - 1`.


Return _the number of *valid splits* in_ `nums`.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [10,4,-8,7]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* 
There are three ways of splitting nums into two non-empty parts:
- Split nums at index 0. Then, the first part is [10], and its sum is 10. The second part is [4,-8,7], and its sum is 3. Since 10 >= 3, i = 0 is a valid split.
- Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is [10,4], and its sum is 14. The second part is [-8,7], and its sum is -1. Since 14 >= -1, i = 1 is a valid split.
- Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [10,4,-8], and its sum is 6. The second part is [7], and its sum is 7. Since 6 < 7, i = 2 is not a valid split.
Thus, the number of valid splits in nums is 2.

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [2,3,1,0]
*Output:* 2
*Explanation:* 
There are two valid splits in nums:
- Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is [2,3], and its sum is 5. The second part is [1,0], and its sum is 1. Since 5 >= 1, i = 1 is a valid split. 
- Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [2,3,1], and its sum is 6. The second part is [0], and its sum is 0. Since 6 >= 0, i = 2 is a valid split.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5^`
* `-10^5^ <= nums[i] <= 10^5^`
