= 1774. Closest Dessert Cost

{leetcode}/problems/closest-dessert-cost/[LeetCode - 1774. Closest Dessert Cost ^]

You would like to make dessert and are preparing to buy the ingredients. You have `n` ice cream base flavors and `m` types of toppings to choose from. You must follow these rules when making your dessert:


* There must be *exactly one* ice cream base.
* You can add *one or more* types of topping or have no toppings at all.
* There are *at most two* of *each type* of topping.


You are given three inputs:


* `baseCosts`, an integer array of length `n`, where each `baseCosts[i]` represents the price of the `i^th^` ice cream base flavor.
* `toppingCosts`, an integer array of length `m`, where each `toppingCosts[i]` is the price of *one* of the `i^th^` topping.
* `target`, an integer representing your target price for dessert.


You want to make a dessert with a total cost as close to `target` as possible.

Return _the closest possible cost of the dessert to _`target`. If there are multiple, return _the *lower* one._

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* baseCosts = [1,7], toppingCosts = [3,4], target = 10
*Output:* 10
*Explanation:* Consider the following combination (all 0-indexed):
- Choose base 1: cost 7
- Take 1 of topping 0: cost 1 x 3 = 3
- Take 0 of topping 1: cost 0 x 4 = 0
Total: 7 + 3 + 0 = 10.
----

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* baseCosts = [2,3], toppingCosts = [4,5,100], target = 18
*Output:* 17
*Explanation:* Consider the following combination (all 0-indexed):
- Choose base 1: cost 3
- Take 1 of topping 0: cost 1 x 4 = 4
- Take 2 of topping 1: cost 2 x 5 = 10
- Take 0 of topping 2: cost 0 x 100 = 0
Total: 3 + 4 + 10 + 0 = 17. You cannot make a dessert with a total cost of 18.
----

<strong class="example">Example 3:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* baseCosts = [3,10], toppingCosts = [2,5], target = 9
*Output:* 8
*Explanation:* It is possible to make desserts with cost 8 and 10. Return 8 as it is the lower cost.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `n == baseCosts.length`
* `m == toppingCosts.length`
* `1 <= n, m <= 10`
* `1 <= baseCosts[i], toppingCosts[i] <= 10^4^`
* `1 <= target <= 10^4^`
