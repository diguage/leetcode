{leetcode}/problems/next-greater-element-iv/[LeetCode - 2454. Next Greater Element IV ^]

You are given a *0-indexed* array of non-negative integers `nums`. For each integer in `nums`, you must find its respective *second greater* integer.

The *second greater* integer of `nums[i]` is `nums[j]` such that:


* `j > i`
* `nums[j] > nums[i]`
* There exists *exactly one* index `k` such that `nums[k] > nums[i]` and `i < k < j`.


If there is no such `nums[j]`, the second greater integer is considered to be `-1`.


* For example, in the array `[1, 2, 4, 3]`, the second greater integer of `1` is `4`, `2` is `3`, and that of `3` and `4` is `-1`.


Return_ an integer array _`answer`_, where _`answer[i]`_ is the second greater integer of _`nums[i]`_._

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [2,4,0,9,6]
*Output:* [9,6,6,-1,-1]
*Explanation:*
0th index: 4 is the first integer greater than 2, and 9 is the second integer greater than 2, to the right of 2.
1st index: 9 is the first, and 6 is the second integer greater than 4, to the right of 4.
2nd index: 9 is the first, and 6 is the second integer greater than 0, to the right of 0.
3rd index: There is no integer greater than 9 to its right, so the second greater integer is considered to be -1.
4th index: There is no integer greater than 6 to its right, so the second greater integer is considered to be -1.
Thus, we return [9,6,6,-1,-1].

<strong class="example">Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*Input:* nums = [3,3]
*Output:* [-1,-1]
*Explanation:*
We return [-1,-1] since neither integer has any integer greater than it.
----

 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5^`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9^`
