= 893. Groups of Special-Equivalent Strings

https://leetcode.com/problems/groups-of-special-equivalent-strings/[LeetCode - Groups of Special-Equivalent Strings]

You are given an array `A` of strings.

A _move onto `S`_ consists of swapping any two even indexed characters of `S`, or any two odd indexed characters of `S`.

Two strings `S` and `T` are _special-equivalent_ if after any number of _moves onto `S`_, `S == T`.

For example, `S = "zzxy"` and `T = "xyzz"` are special-equivalent because we may make the moves `"zzxy" -> "xzzy" -> "xyzz"` that swap `S[0]` and `S[2]`, then `S[1]` and `S[3]`.

Now, a _group of special-equivalent strings from `A`_ is a non-empty subset of A such that:


* Every pair of strings in the group are special equivalent, and;
* The group is the largest size possible (ie., there isn't a string S not in the group such that S is special equivalent to every string in the group)


Return the number of groups of special-equivalent strings from `A`.

 


*Example 1:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* ["abcd","cdab","cbad","xyzz","zzxy","zzyx"]
*Output:* 3
*Explanation:*
One group is ["abcd", "cdab", "cbad"], since they are all pairwise special equivalent, and none of the other strings are all pairwise special equivalent to these.

The other two groups are ["xyzz", "zzxy"] and ["zzyx"].  Note that in particular, "zzxy" is not special equivalent to "zzyx".

*Example 2:*

[subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
----
*Input:* ["abc","acb","bac","bca","cab","cba"]
*Output:* 3
----

 







*Note:*


* `1 <= A.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= A[i].length <= 20`
* All `A[i]` have the same length.
* All `A[i]` consist of only lowercase letters.
