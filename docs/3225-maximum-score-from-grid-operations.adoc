= 3225. Maximum Score From Grid Operations

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-grid-operations/[LeetCode - 3225. Maximum Score From Grid Operations ^]

You are given a 2D matrix `grid` of size `n x n`. Initially, all cells of the grid are colored white. In one operation, you can select any cell of indices `(i, j)`, and color black all the cells of the `j^th^` column starting from the top row down to the `i^th^` row.

The grid score is the sum of all `grid[i][j]` such that cell `(i, j)` is white and it has a horizontally adjacent black cell.

Return the *maximum* score that can be achieved after some number of operations.

 
<strong class="example">Example 1:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">grid = [[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,3,0,0],[0,1,0,0,0],[5,0,0,3,0],[0,0,0,0,2]]

*Output:* <span class="example-io">11

*Explanation:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/05/11/one.png" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;" />
In the first operation, we color all cells in column 1 down to row 3, and in the second operation, we color all cells in column 4 down to the last row. The score of the resulting grid is `grid[3][0] + grid[1][2] + grid[3][3]` which is equal to 11.


<strong class="example">Example 2:*

<div class="example-block">
*Input:* <span class="example-io">grid = [[10,9,0,0,15],[7,1,0,8,0],[5,20,0,11,0],[0,0,0,1,2],[8,12,1,10,3]]

*Output:* <span class="example-io">94

*Explanation:*
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/05/11/two-1.png" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;" />
We perform operations on 1, 2, and 3 down to rows 1, 4, and 0, respectively. The score of the resulting grid is `grid[0][0] + grid[1][0] + grid[2][1] + grid[4][1] + grid[1][3] + grid[2][3] + grid[3][3] + grid[4][3] + grid[0][4]` which is equal to 94.


 
*Constraints:*


* `1 <= n == grid.length <= 100`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^9^`
