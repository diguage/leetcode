/**
 * = 210. Course Schedule II
 *
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/[Course Schedule II - LeetCode]
 *
 * There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.
 *
 * Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`
 *
 * Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite *pairs*, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
 *
 * .Example 1:
 * [source]
 * ----
 * Input: 2, [[1,0]]
 * Output: [0,1]
 * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished
 *              course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1] .
 * ----
 *
 * .Example 2:
 * [source]
 * ----
 * Input: 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
 * Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]
 * Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both
 *              courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
 *              So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3] .
 * ----
 *
 * *Note:*
 *
 * * The input prerequisites is a graph represented by *a list of edges*, not adjacency matrices. Read more about https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs[how a graph is represented].
 * * You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
