/**
 * = 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
 *
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/[Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree - LeetCode]
 *
 * Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
 *
 * According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor[the definition of LCA on Wikipedia]: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”
 *
 * Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
 *
 * .Example 1:
 * [source]
 * ----
 * Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
 * ----
 *
 * .Example 2:
 * [source]
 * ----
 * Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
 * ----
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * All of the nodes' values will be unique.
 * p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.
